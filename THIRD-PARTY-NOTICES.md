- **Source:** https://github.com/iOfficeAI/AionUi
- **License:** Apache License, Version 2.0
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2025 AionUi (aionui.com)
- **Use in Wayland:** Wayland is a derivative work of AionUi. The original AionUi source
  forms the foundation of the Wayland application: the Electron main process, IPC bridge,
  renderer UI scaffolding, agent client protocol integration, MCP services, and the
  multi-CLI cowork architecture all originate from AionUi.

Per the Apache 2.0 License, Section 4(b), files modified by Wayland carry no removal of

root of this repository.

## Wayland-Core (fork of aionrs)

- **Project:** Wayland-Core, a TradeCanyon-maintained fork of aionrs
- **Upstream source:** https://github.com/iOfficeAI/aionrs
- **License:** Apache License, Version 2.0
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2025 aionrs contributors (upstream); modifications Copyright
  2026 TradeCanyon
- **Use in Wayland:** Wayland integrates Wayland-Core as its Rust engine. Source code
  under `src/process/agent/wcore/`, `scripts/prepareWaylandCore.js`, and related
  integration points references the engine as `wayland-core`.
- **Modifications:** Per Apache-2.0 Section 4(b), the following changes have been made
  to the upstream aionrs source. See `engine/CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased section) for the
  authoritative divergence summary:
  - All 11 workspace crates renamed (`aion-*` → `wcore-*`).
  - Compiled binary renamed (`aionrs` → `wayland-core`).
  - Default config file renamed (`.aionrs.toml` → `.wcore.toml`).
  - User config directory renamed (`~/.aionrs` → `~/.wcore`).
  - New `WCORE_*` env vars and template tokens added as primary names; legacy
    `AIONRS_*` forms retained as backward-compat aliases.
  - Original aionrs Apache-2.0 copyright headers are preserved in all forked source
    files.

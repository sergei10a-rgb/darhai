/**
 * Shared gate for suites that need the native better-sqlite3 driver.
 *
 * better-sqlite3 is a native addon compiled for ONE ABI at a time:
 *  - LOCAL dev: postinstall runs `electron-builder install-app-deps`, building it
 *    for the ELECTRON ABI (the GUI needs it). It then fails to load under vitest's
 *    Node ABI with `NODE_MODULE_VERSION`, so these suites skip — a deliberate
 *    dev-convenience skip so a local `bun run test` stays green without a rebuild.
 *    (Run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` to flip it to the Node ABI and run them.)
 *  - CI: postinstall SKIPS the electron rebuild (scripts/postinstall.js), so the
 *    Node-ABI prebuilt is what's installed, vitest runs under Node, the ABI
 *    matches, and these suites RUN.
 *
 * The hazard is that the skip is SILENT: if CI ever stopped shipping a loadable
 * Node-ABI binary, dozens of tests would vanish without a trace and a broken
 * build would look green. So when the module is unavailable IN CI we register a
 * hard-failing test instead of skipping — the coverage loss becomes impossible
 * to miss. Locally the skip is still allowed.

# /legal - Business Legal Orchestrator

Route any legal-template request to the right specialist skill. The orchestrator reads your instruction, picks the matching sub-skill, and delegates. Sub-skills are not registered as slash commands - they are reachable only through this orchestrator (or via explicit `skill_view("business-legal:<skill-name>")`).

## Composite flows

- `/legal saas-launch <product>` - fans out `legal-tos`, `legal-privacy`, and `legal-refund-policy` in parallel for a complete SaaS public-facing legal pack
- `/legal new-hire <role>` - fans out `legal-nda` and `legal-employment` together for hiring kits
- `/legal vendor-onboard <vendor>` - runs `legal-contract` then `legal-nda` (mutual)

## Dispatch instructions

When the user invokes `/legal <verb> [args]`:

1. Match the verb to the routing table above (case-insensitive, accept hyphen or space).
2. Load the matched sub-skill via `skill_view("business-legal:<skill-name>")`.
3. Pass the full original instruction (verb + args) to the sub-skill.
4. **Hard-gate enforcement** - sub-skills enforce their own gates. The orchestrator MUST NOT silently default to "Delaware, USA" for missing jurisdiction. Each sub-skill decides whether jurisdiction is a hard gate (refuse-to-generate after one ask) or a soft default. The current rules:
   - **Hard gate (refuse if missing)**: `legal-nda` (template mode), `legal-tos`, `legal-privacy`, `legal-refund-policy`, `legal-contract`, `legal-contractor`, `legal-eula`, `legal-employment`, `legal-equity-grant`, `legal-gdpr` (DPA mode)
   - **Soft default with prominent flag**: `legal-dmca` (US-centric by design), `legal-cease-and-desist` (sender + recipient jurisdictions both required)
5. If the verb is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before dispatching.
6. If the verb is not in the table, reply with the help table above.

Sub-skills are hidden from the auto-index. They are only reachable through this orchestrator or via `skill_view("business-legal:<skill-name>")`.

## Tooling

Skills in this pack use Wayland-mapped tools:

- Web research: `web_search`, `web_extract`
- File ops: `file_tools.read`, `file_tools.write`, `file_tools.edit`
- Shell: `terminal`
- Sub-agents: `delegate_task`
- Output paths: `build_report_path("business-legal", instruction)`

## Output discipline (every sub-skill)

Every generated document MUST end with the standard disclaimer footer block defined in each sub-skill's SKILL.md. Do not strip it. Do not summarize it. Reproduce it verbatim.

## Disclaimer (repeat on every output)

> _Templates only - not legal advice. Have an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction review every document before signing or distributing._

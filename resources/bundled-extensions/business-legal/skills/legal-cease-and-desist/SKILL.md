# Legal - Cease-and-Desist Letter

Generate a cease-and-desist (C&D) letter. C&Ds are the most-requested generic SMB legal letter - they put a counterparty on notice, create a written record, and can resolve a dispute without litigation. They also carry risk: a poorly worded C&D can expose the sender to anti-SLAPP, _Twiqbal_ counter-suits, FDCPA / state UDAP claims (for debt), declaratory-judgment actions (especially in trademark/copyright), and tortious-interference claims (for overreach). Tone and content must match the dispute's severity and the underlying legal theory.

## When to use

- Trademark infringement (your registered or unregistered mark used by another)
- Copyright infringement (where DMCA §512 doesn't apply or has failed - see `legal-dmca` first for hosted content)
- Defamation (false statements of fact causing reputational harm)
- Breach of contract (NDA, non-compete, license, service agreement)
- Debt collection (between business creditor and debtor - NOT consumer, see warning below)
- Misuse of trade secret or confidential information
- Harassment or stalking with a business / employment nexus
- IP misuse (patent, design rights - generally engage IP counsel directly)

## When NOT to use as-is

- **Consumer debt collection by a third-party debt collector** → FDCPA (15 USC §1692) governs and has technical content / disclosure requirements; this skill is for first-party (original creditor) debt or B2B debt only. Even first-party collection is regulated by state UDAP and statutes like CA Rosenthal Act and NY GBL §601 - surface those.
- **Retaliatory / SLAPP-prone disputes** (defamation against a public commentator, criticism of a public figure, consumer review platforms) → many states have anti-SLAPP statutes that allow the recipient to recover fees. Consult counsel before sending.
- **Patent infringement** → declaratory-judgment risk: a poorly aimed patent C&D can confer subject-matter jurisdiction and let the recipient sue for non-infringement in their preferred forum. Engage patent counsel.
- **Federal employment claims** (Title VII, FLSA, etc.) → statutory pre-suit procedures (EEOC charge) usually required; don't substitute a C&D.

## Required inputs (ask upfront)

1. **Jurisdiction (REQUIRED)** - country + state/province where the sender operates and where the recipient is located. **If unknown, ask once and refuse to generate if missing** - choice-of-law affects every threat-of-litigation phrase.
2. **Violation type** - trademark / copyright / IP / defamation / breach of contract / debt / trade-secret / harassment / other
3. **Sender** - name, role, contact info, attorney-of-record (if any)
4. **Recipient** - name, address (physical address required for legal effectiveness)
5. **Description of conduct** - specific facts, dates, URLs / quotations / receipts where applicable
6. **Demanded action** - cease specific conduct / pay amount / remove content / publish retraction / return materials
7. **Deadline** - typically 10-21 days for response; longer for complex demands
8. **Supporting evidence available** - registration certificates (trademark, copyright), contracts, witnesses, screenshots
9. **Tone preference** - professional (collaborative resolution) / firm (clear demand, no threats) / litigation-threat (explicit reservation of rights and intent to sue)
10. **Pre-litigation considerations** - has the sender consulted counsel? has the recipient been put on prior informal notice?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Choose the letter type

Match violation type to letter template (Step 4 has the canonical text for each).

### Step 2: Choose the tone

| Tone                  | When                                                                                  | Risk                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Professional**      | First contact; relationship preservation matters; recipient may not realize the issue | Low; recipient may ignore                                               |
| **Firm**              | Second contact OR clear violation + uncooperative recipient                           | Moderate; sets up litigation if escalated                               |
| **Litigation-threat** | Last contact before filing; explicit deadline, explicit consequence                   | High - anti-SLAPP / UDAP / declaratory-judgment exposure if overreached |

If the user picks "litigation-threat" tone for any of these scenarios, **escalate the attorney-review warning prominently**:

- Defamation against a consumer reviewer or public commentator (anti-SLAPP risk)
- Patent claim (declaratory-judgment forum-shopping)
- Trademark claim against a similarly-named good-faith user (Lanham Act priority disputes)
- Debt collection across state lines (FDCPA + state UDAP)
- Anything where the underlying claim is genuinely contested

Reply to the user before generating: "You've requested a litigation-threat tone for a [scenario]. This category carries elevated risk of [specific risk]. I will generate the letter, but strongly recommend attorney review before sending. Proceed?"

### Step 3: Confirm the legal theory

For each violation type, ask the user to confirm one factual element - this is a sanity check, not legal advice:

- **Trademark**: do you have a registered mark (Reg No.) OR can you show priority of use in commerce?
- **Copyright**: do you own the work or have an exclusive license? Is it registered? (Registration is prerequisite for statutory damages and attorneys' fees in US.)
- **Defamation**: is the alleged statement (a) false, (b) of fact (not opinion), (c) "of and concerning" the sender, and (d) published to a third party? Are damages provable? In US, public-figure plaintiffs must show "actual malice" (NYT v. Sullivan).
- **Breach of contract**: is the contract in writing? Is the alleged breach material? Has the sender performed its own obligations?
- **Debt**: is there a written agreement or invoice trail? Is the debt within statute of limitations (varies by state, typically 3-6 years)?

If the user cannot answer the basic element check, refuse to generate the litigation-threat tone and downgrade to professional tone with a "let's discuss" frame.

### Step 4: Generate the letter - verbatim canonical templates

#### C. Defamation cease-and-desist

⚠️ **HIGH ANTI-SLAPP RISK** - surface verbatim before generating:

> Defamation C&Ds are frequently the subject of anti-SLAPP motions and counter-suits. A statement that is opinion, fair comment, substantially true, or about a public figure without "actual malice" is not defamatory. If your basis is contested, attorney review is essential before sending.

[State-UDAP cautions to consider including / surfacing for attorney review:]
- California Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Civ. Code §1788 et seq.) extends to first-party creditors for many practices.
- New York GBL §§ 600 et seq. and FDCPA-analog state statutes regulate collection practices.
- Avoid statements that the unpaid debt will be "reported to your credit" unless the creditor actually furnishes data to consumer credit reporting agencies; doing so for B2B credit is acceptable.
- Avoid threats of action that the creditor does not intend to or cannot legally take (FDCPA §1692e - even where FDCPA does not apply, state UDAP claims do).

This letter is sent without prejudice. All rights are reserved.

Sincerely,

[NAME, TITLE]
```

### Step 5: Add evidence section

- Trademark registration certificate, if any
- Copyright registration certificate, if any

### Step 7: Save and CYA reminder

Save to `build_report_path("business-legal", "cease-desist-<recipient>-<date>.md")`.

Before the user sends, surface a final CYA block:

> **Before sending:**
>
> 1. Have an attorney review high-stakes versions (defamation, patent, anti-SLAPP-prone, multi-state debt). The cost of an attorney review is typically $200-$1,000; the cost of a counter-suit or anti-SLAPP fee award is $5,000-$50,000+.
> 2. Send via certified mail with return receipt (creates evidence of delivery) AND email (creates timestamp).
> 3. Keep a copy with the postal receipt and email send confirmation.
> 4. Do not negotiate by phone after sending - every communication may be evidence; route responses to the address in the letter.
> 5. Calendar the deadline; act on it (filing suit, escalating) or the threat erodes credibility.

## Output footer (REQUIRED on every generated document)

End every generated cease-and-desist letter with this block, verbatim:

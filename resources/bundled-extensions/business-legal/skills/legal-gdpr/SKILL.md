# Legal - GDPR / Data-Processing Toolkit

Three modes:

1. **Assess mode** - answer "is this data flow GDPR-compliant?" with a structured analysis
2. **DPA mode** - generate a Data Processing Agreement template (Article 28-compliant)
3. **DPIA mode** - assess whether a Data Protection Impact Assessment is required, and scaffold one if so

> **Important**: GDPR is enforced by 27 different national supervisory authorities, each with their own guidance. This skill produces structured outputs, not advice. A privacy attorney must review.

## Required inputs (ask upfront)

1. **Jurisdiction** - primary country + state/province (default flagged: EU member state)
2. **Industry** - affects special category data, retention requirements
3. **Mode** - assess / DPA / DPIA
4. **Role** - controller / processor / joint-controller
5. **User geography** - which EU/UK regions hold data subjects? Are non-EU subjects involved?
6. **Data categories** - basic / special category (Art. 9) / criminal-conviction (Art. 10) / children
7. **Cross-border transfers** - does data leave the EEA? to which countries? under what mechanism?
8. **Sub-processors** - list (name, location, purpose)
9. **Retention** - by category

## Assess mode

### Step 1: Map the data flow

Produce a table:

| Field                   | Detail                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Personal data category  | (e.g., name, email, IP, health)                                                              |
| Source                  | Direct / third party / public                                                                |
| Lawful basis            | Consent / contract / legal obligation / vital interests / public task / legitimate interests |
| Purpose                 | What you use it for                                                                          |
| Recipients              | Internal teams, sub-processors, third-party recipients                                       |
| Retention               | Period + deletion trigger                                                                    |
| International transfer? | Yes/no; mechanism if yes                                                                     |
| Special category?       | Yes (Art. 9) / no                                                                            |
| Children?               | Yes/no                                                                                       |

### Step 2: Run the compliance checks

For each row, evaluate:

- **Lawful basis adequacy**: is the chosen basis valid for the purpose? (e.g., consent for marketing must be opt-in, freely-given, specific, informed, unambiguous; legitimate-interests balancing test must be documented)
- **Purpose limitation**: is data used only for the stated purpose, or repurposed?
- **Data minimization**: is the data collected the minimum necessary?
- **Accuracy / rectification**: is there a process to correct?
- **Storage limitation**: retention defined and enforced?
- **Integrity / confidentiality**: security measures appropriate?
- **Accountability**: documented in RoPA (Art. 30)?
- **Transparency**: disclosed in the privacy notice?
- **DSR rights**: workflow exists for access / erasure / portability / restriction / objection / automated-decision rights?
- **Children**: parental consent (Art. 8) under 16 (varies 13-16 by member state)?
- **Special category**: explicit consent or other Art. 9(2) basis?

### Step 3: Output the assessment

Save to `build_report_path("business-legal", "gdpr-assess-<flow>-<date>.md")`. Include:

- Executive summary (1-2 sentences: COMPLIANT / GAPS / NON-COMPLIANT)
- Data flow map (Step 1 table)
- Compliance check (Step 2 results, with severity per gap)
- Remediation plan (priority order)
- DPIA recommendation (yes/no + rationale)
- Footer (disclaimer block - see below)

## DPA mode

### Step 1: Determine direction

DPAs flow controller → processor. Confirm which side the user is on. If they're a processor (e.g., a SaaS company taking customer data), they need an "outbound" DPA template they offer to customers. If a controller (e.g., a business buying SaaS), they need a "vendor DPA" template they require sub-processors to sign.

### Step 2: Generate the DPA

Required Article 28 elements:

1. **Subject matter and duration** of processing
2. **Nature and purpose** of processing
3. **Type of personal data** processed
4. **Categories of data subjects**
5. **Obligations and rights of controller**
6. **Processor obligations**:
   - Process only on documented controller instructions
   - Confidentiality of processing personnel
   - Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures (Art. 32)
   - Engage sub-processors only with controller's prior written authorization (specific or general with right to object)
   - Assist controller with DSRs
   - Assist controller with security, breach notification, DPIA, and prior consultation obligations
   - Delete or return data at end of services (controller's choice)
   - Provide controller with information necessary to demonstrate compliance + allow audits
7. **Sub-processor terms** (flow-down: same data-protection obligations)
8. **International transfer mechanism** - append SCCs (2021/914) module 2 or 3 as applicable; UK Addendum if UK data; Swiss Addendum if Swiss data
9. **Security measures** - Annex II (technical and organizational measures)
10. **Data breach notification** - processor must notify controller "without undue delay" (recommend 24-48h)

### Step 3: Save

Save to `build_report_path("business-legal", "dpa-<counterparty>-<date>.md")`.

## DPIA mode

### Step 1: Trigger check

DPIA is mandatory under Art. 35 when processing is "likely to result in a high risk." Mandatory triggers:

- Systematic and extensive evaluation / profiling with legal or similarly significant effects
- Large-scale processing of special categories or criminal-conviction data
- Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas at scale

National supervisory authorities have published "DPIA always required" lists (e.g., CNIL, ICO, DSK). Cross-check the user's flow.

If no mandatory trigger but processing is novel / large-scale / uses new tech / involves vulnerable groups, recommend DPIA as best practice.

### Step 2: Scaffold the DPIA

Required content:

1. **Description of processing** (purposes, categories, recipients, retention, transfers)
2. **Necessity and proportionality** - why this data, why this scope, alternatives considered
3. **Consultation** - DPO, data subjects (where appropriate), supervisory authority (Art. 36 prior consultation if residual risk is high)
4. **Risks to data subjects** - likelihood × severity for each identified risk
5. **Measures to address risks** - technical and organizational
6. **Sign-off** - DPO and accountable executive

### Step 3: Save

Save to `build_report_path("business-legal", "dpia-<flow>-<date>.md")`.

## Cross-border transfer cautions

After Schrems II (CJEU 2020), every transfer of EU personal data to a non-adequacy country requires:

- A valid transfer mechanism (SCCs 2021/914, BCRs, derogations Art. 49)
- A Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) documenting that the destination's law and practice do not undermine the SCC protections
- Supplementary measures where required (encryption, pseudonymization, contractual additions)

For US transfers: the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF, July 2023) restored adequacy for certified US importers. UK and Swiss extensions exist but are separate frameworks.

These are technical and shifting - flag prominently for counsel.

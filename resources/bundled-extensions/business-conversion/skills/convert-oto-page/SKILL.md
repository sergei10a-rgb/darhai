# Convert OTO Page - One-Time Offer

> _"They just bought. The buying brain is open. You have one shot to offer them something that genuinely makes the first thing better. If you waste this moment with a bait-and-switch, the refund email arrives by Tuesday."_

This skill builds the post-checkout One-Time Offer page - Method-applied, conversion-tight, ethically framed.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: `oto page`, `one-time offer page`, `upsell page`, `post-purchase upgrade`, `/convert oto <product>`.

Use when:

- The user just purchased a flagship offer.
- An additional product or upgrade exists that genuinely complements what they bought.
- The user wants to convert this moment without breaking trust.

## When NOT to Use

- **OTO recovery (the page they see if they decline)** → `/convert downsell-page`.
- **Different-product upsell (later in the customer relationship)** → `/convert cross-sell-page`.
- **Pre-purchase sales page** → `/convert sales-page`.
- **Auditing existing OTO** → `/convert audit`.

## Inputs

Required:

1. **The flagship product** - what they just bought (you have to reference it specifically).
2. **The OTO product** - what's on this page. Must genuinely complement.
3. **Price + scarcity** - _real_ one-time pricing. If they can find it elsewhere at the same price, the urgency is fake and the page fails.
4. **One person + Nerve** - same as flagship's brief.
5. **Accept URL** (one-click upgrade if billing supports it) and **Decline URL** (next step in the funnel).

Optional:

- **Existing flagship sales page** - for voice continuity.
- **`out_path`** - defaults via `build_report_path`.

## Workflow - All Eight Method Phases (post-purchase compressed)

The buyer is warm-to-hot. Trust is mostly already established. The page is short - 400–800 words. The Excuse lock does most of the work.

### Phase 0 - Four Questions

Reframed for post-purchase:

- **Why You?** - Why does the OTO matter for the _specific_ purchase they just made?
- **Why Me?** - Already mostly answered. Light Drive-By only.
- **Why This?** - What does the OTO add that the flagship can't, and why is it the right next step?
- **Why Now?** - _Real_ one-time-only reason. Bundling logistics, capacity, pricing transition. Never fake.

### Phase 1 - Temperature

Post-purchase = **Boiling-adjacent**. They already trusted you with their money. Page length 400–800 words. Direct, not pitchy.

### Phase 2 - Four-Layer Open (call `convert-open`)

Compressed:

- Layer 1 = a specific _thank-you-and-pivot_ line that names the purchase.
- Layer 2 = the side-door pivot to the OTO.
- Layer 3 = light Skin in the Game (often "the question I always get next is...").
- Layer 4 = your Fingerprint as a one-line aside.

### Phase 3 - Three Locks

- **Want** = the upgrade itself, framed as completion of the flagship.
- **Trust** = mostly inherited. One micro-proof line.
- **Excuse** = the bulk of the page. Math: "what they save in time / mistakes / dollars."

### Phase 4 - Bullets

5–7 bullets. Mostly Snapshot + Keyhole. The Flip is risky here (don't undermine the flagship they just bought).

### Phase 5 - Proof

One Anecdote ("after I added this to the program, the average customer's results jumped from X to Y..."). One Drive-By. Done.

### Phase 6 - Cascade Close

- Stack - what's added, conversationally.
- Vision - paint where the OTO takes them beyond the flagship's outcome.
- Math - the numbers (time saved, results lifted, dollar comparison).
- Safety Net - usually inherits the flagship's guarantee, plus a no-questions cancel option.
- Door - the Yes button.

Plus a **No, thanks** decline link (small, plain text, below the button - not styled as a button).

### Phase 7 - Greased Chute

Short paragraphs. Open loop into the price reveal. Decline link should not be the visual anchor.

### Phase 8 - Voice + Bullshit Filter

The biggest filter test for OTO copy: _"Is this offer real, or am I manufacturing a moment to extract more money?"_ If the answer isn't "this genuinely makes their first thing better," kill the OTO. Trust matters more than the marginal AOV.

## Section Architecture

| #   | Section                            | Purpose                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | Receipt-of-purchase confirmation   | Anchor what they just bought |
| 2   | Compressed Open (3–4 sentences)    | Pivot to the OTO             |
| 3   | The promise (one paragraph)        | Want lock                    |
| 4   | 5–7 bullets                        | Make the upgrade tangible    |
| 5   | One proof beat                     | Trust lock                   |
| 6   | Stack + price + math (Excuse lock) | Cascade Close core           |
| 7   | Yes button + plain No-thanks link  | Door + decline path          |
| 8   | One-line P.S. (optional)           | Reclose if room              |

CSS notes:

- The accent is intentionally **green** here (the buying-brain "yes" color) - distinct from the flagship sales page red. This is small but matters: the OTO should feel like a confirmation, not a second pitch.
- The "No thanks" link is plain text. If you button-style it, you raise its visual weight to match the Yes button - and conversion drops.
- The order-confirmation line uses `role="status"` so screen readers announce it as a confirmation, not as a heading.

## Output Template

```markdown
# OTO Page - {{OTO_PRODUCT}}

**Flagship just purchased:** {{FLAGSHIP}}
**OTO offered here:** {{OTO_PRODUCT}}
**Real "Why Now":** {{REAL_REASON}}
**Price:** {{ONE_TIME_PRICE}} (vs. retail {{RETAIL_PRICE}} = {{SAVINGS}})

## Phase 0–8 (compressed)

- Why You / Me / This / Now → answers
- Open layers → 3–4 sentences
- Bullets → 5–7 (Sn-heavy)
- Proof → 1 Anecdote + 1 Drive-By
- Cascade Close → Stack + Math + Safety Net + Door + plain decline link
- Voice Rules applied; Bullshit Filter is a separate downstream pass

## Final copy

- Receipt line: "{{LINE}}"
- Headline pivot: "{{H1}}"
- Open paragraph: "{{P}}"
- Promise: "{{P}}"
- Bullets: {{LIST}}
- Proof: "{{P}}"
- Stack: "{{P}}"
- Price line: "{{P}}"
- Math: "{{P}}"
- Guarantee: "{{P}}"
- Yes button: "{{LABEL}}"
- No-thanks: "{{LABEL}}"
- P.S.: "{{P}}"

## HTML reference

{{HTML_BLOCK}}

## Method coverage report
```

Method coverage report:
Open: partial - compressed Open with pivot from purchase; Layers 1-3 in 3-4 sentences, Layer 4 inherited from flagship voice
Three Locks: full - Want (the new outcome), Trust (inherited from flagship + 1 proof), Excuse (the math reframe)
Proof: partial - 1 Anecdote + 1 Drive-By; heavier proof inherited from flagship purchase decision
Bullets: full - 5-7 bullets, Snapshot / Keyhole mix
Cascade Close: partial - Stack / Math / Safety Net / Door + plain decline link + P.S.; Vision and P.P.S. compressed because the buyer is post-purchase
Greased Chute: full - short paragraphs, decline visually subordinate, single-page eye flow
Voice Rules: full - first person, contractions, no marketing-speak; voice continuous with flagship
Temperature: Hot (post-purchase, attention window open)

Ethics: OTO genuinely complements flagship (not bait-and-switch)

Required next step: Run /convert bullshit-filter on this draft before shipping.
The Filter is a SEPARATE pass - this skill cannot grade its own output.

```

## Notes / Cross-Skill Composition

- The OTO must reference the flagship by name in the receipt line. Generic OTO copy that ignores what they just bought reads like a separate funnel - and trust drops.
- If this OTO is declined, the next page should be `/convert downsell-page` (reduced-commitment OTO recovery) OR the standard thank-you page (`/convert thank-you-page`). Pick one in the funnel architecture.
- Avoid stacking more than two OTOs. After the second decline, route to the thank-you page.
- The "No, thanks" link must work. Broken decline links are one of the most common funnel-credibility leaks.

## Lineage

- Post-purchase upgrade canon - long-form direct-response one-shot offer pattern.
- Commitment-and-consistency psychology (the foot-in-the-door mechanism that makes OTO conversion possible) - Cialdini (Influence, 1984).
- Conversational stack framing - Wayland-style adaptation of value-equation logic, expressed in plain prose.
- The Method itself - Дархай-owned operating system.

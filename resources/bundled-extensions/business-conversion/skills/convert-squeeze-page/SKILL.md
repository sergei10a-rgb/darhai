# Convert Squeeze Page - Single-Purpose Opt-In

> _"A squeeze page has one job. One promise. One field. One button. If anything else is on the page, it's stealing attention from the one thing you asked them to do."_

This skill builds a compressed-Method opt-in page: above-fold only, no scroll required, no secondary CTAs.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: `squeeze page`, `opt-in page`, `email capture page`, `waitlist page`, `/convert squeeze <topic>`.

Use when the goal is **email capture** in exchange for a single specific promise - a free guide, a waitlist seat, a free training, an early-access invitation.

## When NOT to Use

- **Long-form sales page** → `/convert sales-page`.
- **Page that delivers the lead magnet after opt-in** → `/convert lead-magnet-page`.
- **Webinar registration (different intent)** → `/convert webinar-reg`.
- **Auditing existing opt-in page** → `/convert audit`.

## Inputs

Required:

1. **The promise** - what specifically does the reader get for their email? Not "tips" - _"the exact 6-email cold sequence that's pulled $1.4M for our agency clients."_
2. **One person + Nerve** (One Person Rule).
3. **Form destination** - where does the email post? (ESP endpoint, webhook URL, ConvertKit form ID, etc.)
4. **Post-opt-in destination** - where do they land after submit? (Usually the lead-magnet page or a thank-you page.)

Optional:

- **Brand colors / logo.**
- **Single proof line** - one Drive-By or one Receipt to add micro-credibility.
- **`out_path`** - defaults via `build_report_path`.

## Workflow - All Eight Method Phases (radically compressed)

A squeeze page can be 60–120 words total. Every Method phase still applies - they just collapse to one or two sentences each.

### Phase 0 - Four Questions (call `convert-four-questions`)

Answer the four, then collapse them into a single headline + single subhead. The headline answers Why You. The subhead answers Why This.

### Phase 1 - Temperature (call `convert-temperature`)

Squeeze pages run cool to warm. For Ice Cold, the squeeze should be reached _after_ a bridge page, not directly. For Hot/Boiling, you can drop the page entirely and use an inline form on the previous asset.

### Phase 2 - Four-Layer Open (call `convert-open`)

Compressed to 1–2 sentences:

- Headline = Layer 1 (Nerve Strike).
- Subhead = Layer 2 (Side Door) + Layer 3 (Skin in Game) compressed.
- Layer 4 (Fingerprint) lives in a single one-line aside under the button.

### Phase 3 - Three Locks (call `convert-three-locks`)

- **Want** = the headline + the promise.
- **Trust** = one Drive-By proof line below the form.
- **Excuse** = there isn't one - opting in is free, so the Excuse lock pre-opens itself.

### Phase 4 - Bullets (call `convert-bullets`)

3 bullets. ONE Keyhole, ONE Snapshot, ONE Flip - that's it. They sit between the subhead and the form. A squeeze with more than 3 bullets is no longer a squeeze.

### Phase 5 - Proof (call `convert-proof`)

One line. Drive-By format. _"From the team that's helped 14,000 SMBs ship paid traffic since 2014."_ That's the entire proof budget.

### Phase 6 - Cascade Close (call `convert-close`)

The form is the close. Button label IS the door. Use the **Door** + **Vision** patterns: button copy paints the state, not the action.

- ✗ "Submit" / "Sign up"
- ✓ "Send me the guide" / "Get the cold-email sequence" / "Reserve my seat"

### Phase 7 - Greased Chute (call `convert-chute`)

There's no scroll, so chute = eye flow. Headline → subhead → bullets → form → proof line → reassurance line. The eye must move from one to the next without bouncing.

### Phase 8 - Voice + Bullshit Filter

Squeeze copy is the most exposed copy you'll write because it's so short. Every word is load-bearing. Read aloud twice.

## Section Architecture (above-fold only)

| #   | Section                    | Lines |
| --- | -------------------------- | ----- |
| 1   | Headline (Nerve Strike)    | 1     |
| 2   | Subhead (Side Door + Skin) | 1     |
| 3   | Three bullets (K + Sn + F) | 3     |
| 4   | Email field + button       | 1     |
| 5   | Privacy/reassurance line   | 1     |
| 6   | Drive-By proof line        | 1     |

Total: ~80 words. Single column. Mobile-first.

## Final copy

- **Headline (L1):** "{{H1}}"

- **Bullet 1 (Keyhole):** "{{B1}}"
- **Bullet 2 (Snapshot):** "{{B2}}"

## Method coverage report
```

Method coverage report:
Open: partial - Layer 1 in headline, Layers 2-3 compressed into the subhead; Layer 4 (Fingerprint) lives across the asset chain, not on this page
Three Locks: partial - Want lock open via headline + bullets; Trust micro-loaded by 1 Drive-By line; Excuse not applicable (free opt-in pre-opens it)
Proof: partial - one Drive-By line only; full proof block is downstream
Bullets: partial - 3-5 max, Keyhole + Snapshot only (Flip and Scar omitted at this scale)
Cascade Close: partial - Door (the button) with Vision in the label; Stack / Math / Safety Net not applicable on a free opt-in
Greased Chute: full - vertical eye flow, headline → subhead → bullets → form, single viewport on mobile
Voice Rules: full - first person, contractions, no marketing-speak
Temperature: {{COOL / WARM}}

Required next step: Run /convert bullshit-filter on this draft before shipping.
The Filter is a SEPARATE pass - this skill cannot grade its own output.

## Notes / Cross-Skill Composition

- For Ice Cold traffic, route through `/convert bridge-page` *first*, then send to this squeeze. Direct Ice Cold → squeeze conversion rates collapse because the reader hasn't been decompressed enough to take even a low-friction action.
- The post-submit page should be the lead-magnet delivery page (`/convert lead-magnet-page`) or a thank-you page (`/convert thank-you-page`) with a secondary offer. Either way, the post-submit URL is part of the squeeze brief - never leave it as "default thank-you" because that's where downstream LTV is built.
- Avoid name-and-email forms unless personalization is absolutely required downstream. Single field beats two fields by 10–25% in most tests. If you must capture a name, ask for it in the welcome email instead - same data, lower opt-in friction.
- The button label is the most under-leveraged conversion lever on a squeeze page. "Send me the guide" beats "Submit" by an embarrassing margin. Make the label the **state** the reader wants ("Show me the system," "Reserve my seat") not the **action** of submitting a form.
- A privacy line that says "we hate spam too" reads as suspicious. The cliché itself raises doubt. Better: "One short email per week. Unsubscribe anytime." Specific beats generic.
- Mobile is where most squeeze pages die - the form sits below the fold on smaller phones. Test on a real device. The headline + subhead + bullets + form should all fit in the first viewport on a 375×667 screen, or you're losing 30%+ of mobile traffic before they even see the button.

## Failure modes to watch

A squeeze page can fail in exactly four ways. Walk this checklist before shipping:

1. **The promise is vague.** "Tips for growing your business" is not a promise - it's a category. *"The exact 6-email cold sequence that's pulled $1.4M for our agency clients"* is a promise. If the reader can't paraphrase the promise back in one sentence, the promise is too vague.
2. **The bullets are clever instead of specific.** Clever bullets that depend on wordplay underperform specific bullets that name a number, a page, or a person. Lead with the specific.
3. **The button label is generic.** "Sign up," "Submit," "Continue" - all dead. Replace with a Vision-flavored label that previews the post-opt-in state.
4. **The proof line is missing.** Even one Drive-By line under the form lifts conversion measurably on cold-to-cool traffic. Don't ship without it.

- Headline mechanics - Caples (Tested Advertising Methods, 1932).
- Awareness-level fit (squeeze typically targets levels 2–3) - Schwartz (Breakthrough Advertising, 1966).
- The Method itself - Дархай-owned operating system.

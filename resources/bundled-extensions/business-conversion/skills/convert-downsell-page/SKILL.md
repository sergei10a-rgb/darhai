  Author OTO recovery (downsell) pages: reduced-commitment offer after an OTO decline, with explicit acknowledgment of the prior "no" and a smaller, easier yes. Emits brief + paste-ready HTML/CSS.
  Use when an OTO has been declined and the user wants a softer recovery offer to capture buyers who balked at the upsell price or scope.
  Not for the original OTO (see /convert oto-page) or cross-sells (see /convert cross-sell-page).

# Convert Downsell Page - OTO Recovery

> _"They said no. Don't pretend they didn't. Acknowledge the no, then offer something smaller that's genuinely easier to say yes to. Done right, the downsell rescues 15-30% of the buyers who balked. Done wrong, it makes the brand feel desperate."_

This skill builds the page that follows an OTO decline. Reduced-commitment psychology, explicit acknowledgment of the previous decision, and tight Method-applied copy.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: `downsell page`, `oto recovery`, `convert downsell`, `reduced commitment offer`, `/convert downsell <product>`.

Use when:

- An OTO was just declined (the page that fires on click-through from the OTO's "No, thanks" link).
- A reduced-scope or reduced-price version of the OTO genuinely exists.
- The user wants to recover some of the lost OTO conversion.

## When NOT to Use

- **The original OTO page** → `/convert oto-page`.
- **Different-product cross-sell** → `/convert cross-sell-page`.
- **Generic thank-you page** → `/convert thank-you-page`.
- **Auditing existing downsell** → `/convert audit`.

## Inputs

Required:

1. **The flagship product** - what they bought first.
2. **The OTO they just declined** - referenced explicitly. The downsell page must acknowledge the no.
3. **The downsell product** - must be either: a reduced-scope version of the OTO, a payment-plan version, or a related smaller offer.
4. **Real "Why this is different from the OTO"** - what changed? Smaller scope? Easier price? Trial? If the answer is "same product cheaper," the original OTO price was wrong and should be re-examined.
5. **Accept URL + Decline URL.**

Optional:

- **Voice continuity notes from the flagship + OTO.**
- **`out_path`** - defaults via `build_report_path`.

## Workflow - All Eight Method Phases (post-decline compressed)

### Phase 0 - Four Questions (call `convert-four-questions`)

Reframed for post-decline:

- **Why You?** - Why this _smaller_ thing, given they passed on the bigger thing?
- **Why Me?** - Inherited.
- **Why This?** - What's _different_ about this offer vs. the OTO?
- **Why Now?** - The same one-time mechanic, but honest. Often: "you only see this because you already bought; closing this page = it's gone."

### Phase 1 - Temperature

**Hot-but-cooling.** They bought, then declined. Page must be very short - 200–500 words. Less is more.

### Phase 2 - Four-Layer Open (call `convert-open`)

Compressed and **acknowledgment-led**:

- Layer 1 = explicit acknowledgment of the no. _"Got it - the [OTO] wasn't the right fit. Hear me out for thirty seconds before you go..."_
- Layer 2 = side-door pivot to the smaller offer.
- Layer 3 = quick why-I'm-doing-this Skin in Game.
- Layer 4 = Fingerprint as one-line aside.

### Phase 3 - Three Locks

- **Want** = the smaller, easier scope. Sell the _easier_ state, not the same state.
- **Trust** = inherited from flagship purchase. Almost no proof needed.
- **Excuse** = the math is even easier here. _"For $X you get the part of [OTO] that does [the most-asked-about thing]."_

### Phase 4 - Bullets

3–5 bullets only. Snapshot-heavy. Show what's _included_ - and (briefly, honestly) what's _not_. Transparency about what's missing builds the trust this page needs.

### Phase 5 - Proof

One inherited Drive-By. No new proof block. The page stands on the trust already built.

### Phase 6 - Cascade Close

- Stack - small, conversational.
- Math - _"[smaller price] for [scoped feature]."_
- Safety Net - same guarantee mechanic.
- Door - Yes button, plain No-thanks decline link.

No P.S. - the page is short enough that a P.S. would feel redundant.

### Phase 7 - Greased Chute

Two paragraphs above the bullets, three paragraphs around the offer, button. That's it.

### Phase 8 - Voice + Bullshit Filter

The biggest filter test: _"Does this downsell exist because it's genuinely easier, or because we're trying to extract the buyer at any cost?"_ If the latter, kill the downsell. Buyers detect desperation in milliseconds.

| 4   | Inherited proof / Drive-By                    | 1     |
| 5   | Stack + price + guarantee                     | 3–4   |

CSS notes:

- The same green CTA as the OTO. Don't switch to a "louder" color here - that signals desperation.
- The "Not included" line is _italic_ not bold. Honest, not screaming. The honesty _is_ the conversion lever.
- Wider line-height for the body (1.55) because the page is short and the eye moves fast - extra breathing room helps comprehension.

## Output Template

```markdown
# Downsell Page - {{DOWNSELL_PRODUCT}}

**Flagship purchased:** {{FLAGSHIP}}
**OTO declined:** {{OTO}}
**Downsell offered:** {{DOWNSELL}} ({{REAL_DIFFERENCE_FROM_OTO}})
**Price:** {{DOWNSELL_PRICE}} (vs. OTO {{OTO_PRICE}})

## Phase 0–8 (compressed)

- Acknowledgment of the no (Layer 1)
- Pivot to smaller offer (Layer 2)
- Inherited trust (no new proof needed beyond 1 Drive-By)
- 3–5 bullets including ONE honest "not included" line
- Cascade Close: Stack + Math + Safety Net + Door + plain decline
- Voice Rules applied; Bullshit Filter is a separate downstream pass
- Ethics: downsell is genuinely easier, not desperation

## Final copy

- Acknowledgment headline: "{{H1}}"
- Open paragraph: "{{P}}"
- Bullets: {{LIST_INCLUDING_NOT_INCLUDED_LINE}}
- Inherited proof: "{{LINE}}"
- Stack: "{{P}}"
- Price line: "{{P}}"
- Guarantee: "{{P}}"
- Yes button: "{{LABEL}}"
- No-thanks: "{{LABEL}}"

## HTML reference

{{HTML_BLOCK}}

## Method coverage report
```

Method coverage report:
Open: full - acknowledgment-led Layer 1, Side Door pivot, light Skin in Game, Fingerprint aside
Three Locks: full - Want (smaller scope), Trust (inherited + 1 Drive-By), Excuse (easy math)
Proof: partial - inherited from flagship + 1 Drive-By line; no fresh proof block at this scale
Bullets: full - 3-5, Snapshot-heavy with one honest "not included" line
Cascade Close: partial - Stack / Math / Safety Net / Door + plain decline link; Vision and P.S./P.P.S. omitted (post-decline tone calls for less, not more)
Greased Chute: full - very short paragraphs, no walls of text, single-page eye flow
Voice Rules: full - first person, contractions, no marketing-speak, no desperation
Temperature: Hot (post-decline, attention partially open)

Ethics: downsell genuinely easier (not the OTO at a discount with the same scope)

Required next step: Run /convert bullshit-filter on this draft before shipping.
The Filter is a SEPARATE pass - this skill cannot grade its own output.

```

## Notes / Cross-Skill Composition

- The acknowledgment headline is non-negotiable. Pages that pretend the previous decline didn't happen feel manipulative.
- The "Not included" line is the secret weapon. Buyers expect spin; they get honesty; conversion lifts.
- If this downsell is also declined, route to the standard thank-you page (`/convert thank-you-page`). Do not chain a third reduced offer.
- Avoid stacking: flagship → OTO → downsell → second downsell. Two recovery offers feels desperate by the second one.

## Lineage

- Door-in-the-face concession psychology - Cialdini (Influence, 1984).
- Reciprocity / smaller-yes mechanics - same canon.
- Long-form direct-response funnel structure - informed by direct-mail "smaller offer letter" pattern.
- The Method itself - Дархай-owned operating system.

  Author thank-you pages with a deliberate secondary-offer stack: deliver the promised asset, calibrate next-step CTA, and use the under-leveraged post-conversion surface to lift downstream metrics. Emits brief + paste-ready HTML/CSS.
  Use when the user needs a thank-you page after opt-in or post-purchase that does more than say "thanks" - it bridges to the next step.
  Not for OTOs (see /convert oto-page), downsells (see /convert downsell-page), or cross-sells (see /convert cross-sell-page).

# Convert Thank-You Page - Delivery + Secondary Offer Stack

> _"The thank-you page is the most under-leveraged surface in most funnels. The visitor just said yes. They trust you more in this five-second window than they will at any point until they get a result. Use it."_

This skill builds the thank-you page: deliver the promise, set the next-step expectation, and stack a secondary offer or invitation that fits the moment.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: `thank you page`, `thanks page`, `post-opt-in page`, `confirmation page`, `delivery page`, `/convert thank-you <context>`.

Use when:

- A visitor just submitted a form (lead magnet, squeeze, webinar reg) or completed a purchase.
- The page needs to (1) deliver/confirm the promise and (2) carry forward toward the next funnel step.
- The user wants to use the post-conversion attention window.

## When NOT to Use

- **Immediate post-checkout upgrade** → `/convert oto-page`.
- **OTO recovery** → `/convert downsell-page`.
- **Days-later lateral offer** → `/convert cross-sell-page`.
- **The lead-magnet opt-in page itself** → `/convert lead-magnet-page`.
- **Auditing existing thank-you page** → `/convert audit`.

## Inputs

Required:

1. **What just happened** - opt-in for a lead magnet? Webinar registration? Purchase confirmation?
2. **The deliverable** - what they should expect (download link visible, email arrived, calendar invite, etc.) and within what time window.
3. **The next step** - what's the _one_ thing the user should do next? (Watch a welcome video, book a call, join a community, browse a related offer.)
4. **One person + Nerve** (One Person Rule, post-conversion version).

Optional:

- **Secondary offer** - if there's a relevant tripwire / book / micro-course / call booking.
- **Brand voice notes from the prior page.**
- **Calendar booking embed code** (if the next step is a call).
- **`out_path`** - defaults via `build_report_path`.

## Workflow - All Eight Method Phases (compressed; this is a confirmation page first, conversion page second)

### Phase 0 - Four Questions (call `convert-four-questions`)

For thank-you pages, the Four Questions reframe:

- **Why You?** - Why does the next step matter for _you_ given what you just did?
- **Why Me?** - Inherited.
- **Why This?** - Why this _specific_ next step (and not "follow us on social").
- **Why Now?** - The window matters: "while you're here..." or "before the email arrives..."

### Phase 1 - Temperature

The visitor is **Hot** - they just converted. Page length 200–600 words. Focus is delivery + one calibrated next step, not a second sales pitch.

### Phase 2 - Four-Layer Open (call `convert-open`)

Compressed and confirmation-led:

- Layer 1 = explicit confirmation. _"You're in. Here's what happens next."_
- Layer 2 = side-door pivot to the next step.
- Layer 3 = light Skin in the Game.
- Layer 4 = Fingerprint as one-line aside.

### Phase 3 - Three Locks

- **Want** = the next-step state ("by Friday, you'll have implemented step 1").
- **Trust** = inherited fully.
- **Excuse** = the next step is usually low-friction (watch a video, book a call) so the Excuse is built in.

### Phase 4 - Bullets

3–5 bullets only, listing what the visitor should expect. Mostly utility bullets (when the email arrives, what to look for, what to do first).

### Phase 5 - Proof

Optional. One Drive-By is enough if there's a secondary offer. If the page is delivery-only, no proof needed.

### Phase 6 - Cascade Close

The "next step" CTA is the close:

- Vision close on what the next step delivers.
- Door = the button.

If a secondary offer exists, a compact Stack + Math + Safety Net block sits below the next-step CTA - _clearly subordinated visually_ so it doesn't compete with delivery.

### Phase 7 - Greased Chute

Top half = delivery + next step. Bottom half = optional secondary offer. The two halves should not blur together.

### Phase 8 - Voice + Bullshit Filter

The biggest filter test: _"Does the secondary offer actually serve the visitor at this moment, or am I just refusing to leave money on the table?"_ If the latter, drop the secondary offer entirely and let the page be a clean thank-you.

## Section Architecture

| #   | Section                                                | Purpose            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1   | Confirmation headline                                  | Layer 1            |
| 2   | What happens next (3-5 bullets)                        | Delivery clarity   |
| 3   | Inline delivery (download link / video / instructions) | Promise fulfilled  |
| 4   | Next-step CTA (the _one_ action)                       | Cascade Close core |
| 5   | (Optional) Secondary offer block                       | Calibrated stack   |
| 6   | One-line Fingerprint aside                             | Voice anchor       |

CSS notes:

- The green confirmation banner at the top resolves the "did it work?" anxiety in one glance. Without it, visitors second-guess and refresh.
- The secondary offer is **visually subordinated** - dashed border, smaller CTA, ink-on-white instead of green-on-white. This is deliberate. A secondary offer that competes visually with the next-step CTA cannibalizes the primary outcome.
- Inline delivery (download link / video / instructions) sits in a white card right next to the next-step CTA so the eye moves: confirm → delivered → next step.

## Output Template

```markdown
# Thank-You Page - {{CONTEXT_OPT_IN_OR_PURCHASE}}

**What just happened:** {{DESCRIPTION}}
**Deliverable:** {{WHAT_THEY_GET}} - within {{TIMEFRAME}}
**Next step (the one):** {{NEXT_STEP}}
**Secondary offer (optional):** {{SECONDARY_OR_NONE}}

## Phase 0–8 (compressed)

- Four Questions: post-conversion versions
- Open: confirmation-led, pivot to next step
- Locks: Want (next-step state) / Trust (inherited) / Excuse (low-friction)
- Bullets: 3–5 utility bullets
- Cascade Close: Vision + Door (next-step CTA) + optional subordinated secondary stack
- Voice: full pass; Filter run separately as a coaching pass via `convert-bullshit-filter` before ship

## Final copy

- Confirmation banner: "{{LINE}}"
- Headline: "{{H1}}"
- Side-door pivot paragraph: "{{P}}"
- "What happens next" bullets: {{LIST}}
- Inline delivery line: "{{P}}"
- Next-step CTA: "{{LABEL}}"
- Fingerprint aside: "{{LINE}}"
- (Optional) Secondary offer header / body / CTA: {{IF_PRESENT}}
- P.S.: "{{P}}"

## HTML reference

{{HTML_BLOCK}}

## Method coverage report
```

Open: partial - confirmation-led; Side Door pivot, Skin-in-Game, Fingerprint aside present
Three Locks: compressed - Want (next-step state), Trust (inherited from prior page), Excuse (low-friction next step)
Proof: partial - optional Drive-By only (no full proof rhythm; not applicable post-conversion)
Bullets: compressed - 3–5 utility bullets only (not the full Bullet System)
Cascade Close: compressed - Vision + Door (next-step CTA); optional subordinated secondary Stack/Math if a secondary offer is present
Greased Chute: full - confirm → delivery → next step → optional secondary
Voice Rules: full - first person, contractions, no marketing-speak
Temperature: post-conversion (typically Boiling - recently bought; minimal copy)

Required next step: Run /convert bullshit-filter on this draft before shipping.
The Filter is a SEPARATE coaching pass - this skill cannot grade its own output.

Ethics check: secondary offer (if present) genuinely fits the moment, not bolted on for AOV.

```

```

## Notes / Cross-Skill Composition

- The post-opt-in thank-you page is the most under-leveraged surface in most funnels. Even just adding a _single_ calibrated next-step CTA (book a call, watch the welcome video) lifts downstream conversion measurably.
- For the post-purchase thank-you page that follows a flagship + OTO sequence, this page should be clean delivery - the OTO/downsell already did the conversion work.
- For webinar-reg thank-you pages, the next-step CTA should usually be "add to calendar" + watch a 90-second prep video.
- Secondary offers belong here only if they genuinely serve the moment. When in doubt, drop them.

## Lineage

- Post-conversion attention-window leverage - direct-response info-marketing tradition.
- Reciprocity at the moment of conversion - Cialdini (Influence, 1984).
- Commitment-and-consistency next-step framing - same canon.
- The Method itself - Дархай-owned operating system.

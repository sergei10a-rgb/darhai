# Convert Sales Page - The Long-Form Direct-Response Sales Page

> _"Know who you're talking to and where they are. Answer the Four Questions before you write a word. Open through the Side Door with Skin in the Game and your Fingerprint. Build desire, earn trust, give them the excuse to buy. Close from every angle. Then close again."_ - The Donahoe Method, in one paragraph

This is the flagship of the conversion pack. It applies all eight Donahoe Method frameworks top-to-bottom and emits three things: a structured editorial brief, a paste-ready HTML/CSS reference implementation, and a Method audit footer.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: `write me a sales page`, `build me a sales page`, `long-form sales page`, `donahoe sales page`, `direct response sales page`, `flagship sales page`, `/convert sales-page <product>`.

Use this when:

- The user has a product, course, service, or offer that needs a complete long-form page (1,500–8,000 words depending on temperature).
- The reader needs to be taken from cold to sold inside a single page.
- Both copy AND a deployable HTML scaffold are needed.

## When NOT to Use

- **Auditing an existing live page** → `/market landing <url>` (CRO teardown of someone else's page) or `/convert audit` (Method-scoring an existing draft).
- **Rewriting existing copy** → `/convert rewrite` (preserves voice while applying Method).
- **Short opt-in page** → `/convert squeeze`.
- **Video sales letter script** → `/convert vsl`.
- **VSL hosting page** → `/convert vsl-page`.
- **Designing the offer itself** (value equation, bonuses, pricing) → `/funnel offer`.
- **Sequencing the page in a campaign** → `/funnel build-campaign` or `/funnel ladder`.

## Inputs

Required:

1. **Product description** - what is being sold? What does it actually do?
2. **The one person** - name, city, situation, last failure. Donahoe Voice Rule #1: One Person Rule. If the user supplies a segment ("course creators"), ask once for one specific human.
3. **The Nerve** - the specific raw pain that's bothering them this morning. Sensory, not abstract.
4. **Offer** - price, what's included, deliverables, any bonuses, guarantee terms.

Optional:

- **Author voice notes** - signature phrases, profanity tolerance, tone. If absent, default to The Donahoe Voice Rules.
- **Existing proof assets** - testimonials, case study numbers, screenshots, named customers.
- **Temperature override** - if the user knows the traffic is cold/cool/warm/hot, accept; otherwise classify via `convert-temperature`.
- **Brand colors / logo** - for the HTML scaffold's CSS custom properties.
- **`out_path`** - defaults via `build_report_path("business-conversion", instruction)`.

## Workflow - Phase -1 plus All Eight Method Phases

The page-builder MUST walk Phase -1 (VoC mining) plus all eight Method phases. Skipping any phase produces broken copy.

### Phase -1 - Voice-of-Customer Mining (HARD GATE - refuse to proceed without it)

Halbert's "person who" letter style and Schwartz's awareness-level sequencing both require one thing the seller cannot fake: **the buyer's actual language**. Without it, every framework that follows generates from the seller's mental model, not the buyer's. The page reads _plausible_ but never _resonant_.

This skill REFUSES to proceed to Phase 0 until the VoC bank exists. Ask once. If the user says they don't have one, hand them the 30-minute mining playbook below. Do not start writing without it.

#### What to collect - 5 to 10 verbatim quotes

The quotes must come from the reader's actual mouth/keyboard, not the seller's hypothesis. Sources, in order of diagnostic value:

1. **Amazon reviews of similar / competing products** - especially the **3-star reviews** (most diagnostic - buyer is engaged enough to write, but unhappy enough to name what's missing).
2. **Support tickets / customer-service transcripts** - pre-purchase questions show objections; post-purchase complaints show desired-outcome gaps.
3. **Sales-call transcripts** - prior calls with this avatar; pull pain quotes, "what I tried before" quotes, and "what would success look like" answers.
4. **Reddit / Quora / forum threads** - search the niche subreddit or forum for the problem term; the comments are the language.
5. **Customer interview voice memos** - even one 20-minute call with one buyer beats a hundred reviews.
6. **Email replies from the existing list** - paste the question "what's the hardest part of [problem] right now?" and read the replies as raw material.

Aim for 5-10 quotes total, balanced across pain, desired-outcome, and objection categories (3-5 each).

#### VoC bank format (capture before writing a word)

```
## VoC Bank - <YYYY-MM-DD>

### Pain quotes (3-5)
- "Quote 1, verbatim, with original spelling/grammar." - [source: Reddit r/<sub>, 2026-04-12]
- "Quote 2, verbatim." - [source: 3-star Amazon review of <competitor product>, 2026-03-08]
- "Quote 3, verbatim." - [source: support ticket #1247]

### Desired-outcome quotes (3-5)
- "Quote 1, verbatim - what they said success would look like." - [source: existing testimonial we have]
- "Quote 2, verbatim." - [source: sales call transcript with <name>, 2026-04-22]

### Objection quotes (3-5)
- "I tried [competitor] before and it didn't work because..." - [source: Reddit thread]
- "I'd buy this but I'm worried about..." - [source: support ticket]
- "What if my situation is different because..." - [source: sales-call objection log]
```

Keep the original spelling, profanity, fragments, and run-ons. Cleaning the quote up destroys its value - the rough edges are the proof of authenticity.

#### How Phase 1+ uses the VoC bank (load-bearing)

The VoC bank is not a research artifact filed away. Each downstream phase MUST pull from it:

- **Phase 2 (Layer 1 Nerve Strike)** MUST quote or near-paraphrase a **pain quote** from the bank. The first sentence of the page is the buyer's words played back to them, not the seller's invention.
- **Phase 3 (Three Locks - The Want)** MUST surface **desired-outcome quotes** verbatim where possible. Lock 1 sells the state in the buyer's own words.
- **Phase 4 (Bullets)** MUST surface the **objection quotes** - every Flip and Scar bullet should map to an objection from the bank. If a bullet doesn't trace to a real objection, cut it.
- **Phase 5 (Proof)** uses **desired-outcome quotes** from existing customers as Namecheck and Receipt material when the user has them.
- **Phase 8 (Bullshit Filter)** - for every paragraph in the final draft, ask: _"Is the buyer's language anywhere in this paragraph? Or is this all my language?"_ If the page is 100% seller-voice, it has failed regardless of what the Filter says about marketing-speak.

#### If the user says "I don't have a VoC bank"

Do not write the page. Hand them this 30-minute mining playbook and wait for the bank.

```
## 30-Minute VoC Mining Playbook

Goal: 5-10 verbatim quotes (3-5 pain, 3-5 desired-outcome, 3-5 objection).

Minutes 0-10 - Amazon mine
- Search Amazon for the closest competing book / product to your offer.
- Filter to 3-star reviews. Read 5. Pull 2 pain quotes + 1 desired-outcome quote verbatim.

Minutes 10-20 - Reddit mine
- Search the niche subreddit (r/<niche>) for the problem term ("can't write copy", "stuck at $5k months", etc.).
- Read the top 3 threads. Pull 2 pain quotes + 1 objection quote verbatim.
  Bonus: scroll the comments - the dissenters in the thread are your objection bank.

Minutes 20-30 - Sales-call / list mine
- If you have prior sales-call notes: pull 1 pain + 1 desired-outcome + 1 objection.
- If you don't: post one question to your list ("what's the hardest part of [problem] right now?") and pull from the replies tomorrow.

If you have NO list and NO prior calls: do the Amazon + Reddit pass twice (different competitors,
different threads) and you'll still get 6-8 usable quotes. That's enough to write Layer 1.
```

Do not start the page until the bank exists. The skill exits Phase -1 only when 5+ verbatim, sourced quotes are in hand.

### Phase 0 - Diagnostic: The Four Questions

Call `convert-four-questions` (or run inline) before writing a single section. Answer from the reader's perspective:

- **Why You?** - Why should THIS person care, today, this Tuesday?
- **Why Me?** - Why are _you_ qualified to help them with _this_? (Skin in the Game, not credential dump.)
- **Why This?** - What's the mechanism that makes this approach different (not "better" - _different_)?
- **Why Now?** - Real reason to act today. If there isn't one, don't manufacture one.

If any answer is weak or generic, stop and refine. The whole page rests on these four answers.

### Phase 1 - Temperature Classification

Call `convert-temperature` to classify the reader as Ice Cold / Cool / Warm / Hot / Boiling.

- **Ice Cold** → Lead with pattern interrupt + education. Page length 4,000–8,000 words.
- **Cool** → Name the problem precisely, introduce category of solution. 3,000–5,000 words.
- **Warm** → Differentiate. Mechanism does the work. 2,500–4,000 words.
- **Hot** → Persuasion + risk reversal. 1,500–3,000 words.
- **Boiling** → Short, direct, almost a reminder. 800–1,500 words.

Temperature determines the word budget and the depth of every section below. Writing hot copy for a cold audience is the most common cause of page failure - do not skip this step.

### Phase 2 - The Four-Layer Open

Call `convert-open`. Generate the hero/above-fold open using all four layers in 3–5 sentences:

1. **Nerve Strike** - first sentence hits the raw pain they feel today.
2. **Side Door** - casual entry, not a frontal pitch.
3. **Skin in the Game** - within sentences 3–4, why _you_ are telling them.
4. **Fingerprint** - the only-you moment (opinion, comparison, vivid image, contrarian take).

This becomes the first content the reader sees. The headline lives inside Layer 1 or sits just above it.

### Phase 3 - Three Locks Architecture

Call `convert-three-locks` to architect the body:

- **Lock 1 - The Want** → Sections 5–7 (sell the _state_, not the product).
- **Lock 2 - The Trust** → Sections 8–10 (Conversational Proof, mechanism, big claim).
- **Lock 3 - The Excuse** → Sections 11–12 (offer stack + math justification).

All three locks must open before the reader can buy. Map each section to a lock; if a section doesn't open a lock, cut it.

### Phase 4 - Bullets

Call `convert-bullets` to generate the bullet block (Section 10). 8–15 bullets, mixed across four types:

- **Keyhole** - "The [unexpected thing] that [specific result]. (Page 14)"
- **Flip** - "Why [common practice] is actually costing you - and what to do instead."
- **Snapshot** - "How [name] used this to [measurable result] in [timeframe]."
- **Scar** - "The one mistake that [dramatic consequence] - I made it myself in [year]."

No bullet should sound like marketing. Each must be specific, sensory, curiosity-gap-shaped.

### Phase 5 - Proof, Woven Throughout

Call `convert-proof`. Conversational Proof never lives in one "proof section" - it runs through every claim. The rhythm: Claim → Evidence (story or specific) → Reason → Move on.

Five proof types, used as needed:

- **Anecdote** - "Here's what happened when..."
- **Receipt** - exact numbers, dates, dollar amounts.
- **Drive-By** - credentials mentioned in passing, never announced.
- **Namecheck** - "A guy named Mike sent me an email..."
- **Because** - the logical reason the mechanism works.

Every major claim gets at least one layer of proof within 2–3 sentences of the claim.

### Phase 6 - Cascade Close

Call `convert-close`. The Cascade Close is Section 13:

- **Stack** - list everything they get, conversationally.
- **Vision Close** - paint the desired state 90 days from now.
- **Math Close** - the numbers, the cost-of-inaction comparison.
- **Safety Net** - guarantee so strong it's almost absurd.
- **Door** - simple click instruction.

Then Section 16: **P.S.** (recloses from another angle) and **P.P.S.** (restates strongest proof or guarantee).

### Phase 7 - Greased Chute Throughout

Call `convert-chute`. Engineer momentum across the entire page:

- **Open loops** at section transitions ("But that's not even the interesting part...").
- **Short paragraphs** - 1–3 sentences. White space is pacing.
- **Varied rhythm** - short punch, longer breath, short again.
- **Curiosity transitions** - never end a section with a conclusion; end with a tease.
- **Read-aloud test** - every place you'd stumble, the reader will check their phone. Fix it.

Apply chute discipline to every section before moving on.

### Phase 8 - Voice Pass + Bullshit Filter

Final pass. Call `convert-voice` then `convert-bullshit-filter`.

Voice Rules:

- First person ("I", "you" - never "we", "customers").
- Contractions throughout.
- Mixed sentence lengths.
- No marketing-speak (banned: leverage, optimize, revolutionary, game-changing, unlock potential, take to the next level).
- Specificity over generality.
- Visceral over abstract.

Bullshit Filter - for every paragraph: _"Would I actually say this to someone I'm trying to help?"_ If no, rewrite until yes.

CSS notes for the writer:

- The serif body type signals editorial / direct-mail rather than SaaS. Replace with a sans-serif if the offer is technical and the audience is engineers.
- `--accent` is the only loud color. Keep it singular. The CTA, the proof rule, and the bullet markers all share it so the eye keeps returning to the action.
- The page is single-column, max 720px wide. Long-form copy reading at 60–75 characters per line. Do not introduce a sidebar.

## Output Template (the report you write to disk)

```markdown
# Sales Page: {{PRODUCT}}

**One person:** {{NAME}}, {{CITY}}, {{SITUATION}}
**The Nerve:** {{NERVE_SENTENCE}}
**Temperature:** {{ICE_COLD/COOL/WARM/HOT/BOILING}}
**Word budget:** {{N}} words
**Offer:** {{PRICE}} - {{WHAT_IS_INCLUDED}} - {{GUARANTEE_TERMS}}

## Phase -1 - Voice-of-Customer Bank

### Pain quotes (3-5)

- "{{PAIN_QUOTE_1}}" - [source: {{SOURCE_1}}]
- "{{PAIN_QUOTE_2}}" - [source: {{SOURCE_2}}]
- "{{PAIN_QUOTE_3}}" - [source: {{SOURCE_3}}]

### Desired-outcome quotes (3-5)

- "{{OUTCOME_QUOTE_1}}" - [source: {{SOURCE}}]
- "{{OUTCOME_QUOTE_2}}" - [source: {{SOURCE}}]
- "{{OUTCOME_QUOTE_3}}" - [source: {{SOURCE}}]

### Objection quotes (3-5)

- "{{OBJECTION_QUOTE_1}}" - [source: {{SOURCE}}]
- "{{OBJECTION_QUOTE_2}}" - [source: {{SOURCE}}]
- "{{OBJECTION_QUOTE_3}}" - [source: {{SOURCE}}]

**VoC -> Page mapping:**

- Layer 1 Nerve Strike sources from: {{PAIN_QUOTE_N}}
- Lock 1 (Want) sources from: {{OUTCOME_QUOTE_N}}
- Bullet block (Flip / Scar) sources from: {{OBJECTION_QUOTE_N}}

## Phase 0 - Four Questions

- **Why You?** {{ANSWER}}
- **Why Me?** {{ANSWER}}
- **Why This?** {{ANSWER}}
- **Why Now?** {{ANSWER}}

## Phase 1 - Temperature

{{CLASSIFICATION}} - {{ONE_LINE_RATIONALE}}

## Phase 2 - Four-Layer Open

> {{FULL_OPEN_3_TO_5_SENTENCES}}

Layer breakdown:

- **Nerve Strike:** "{{QUOTE}}"
- **Side Door:** "{{QUOTE}}"
- **Skin in Game:** "{{QUOTE}}"
- **Fingerprint:** "{{QUOTE}}"

## Phase 3 - Three Locks Map

- **Want (sections 5–7):** {{ONE_LINE}}
- **Trust (sections 8–10):** {{ONE_LINE}}
- **Excuse (sections 11–12):** {{ONE_LINE}}

## Phase 4 - Bullet Block (10–15)

- {{BULLETS}} (typed: K=Keyhole F=Flip Sn=Snapshot Sc=Scar)

## Phase 5 - Proof Rhythm

{{LIST_OF_CLAIMS_AND_THEIR_PAIRED_PROOF_TYPES}}

## Phase 6 - Cascade Close

{{FULL_CLOSE_TEXT}}

## Phase 7 - Chute Notes

- Open loops planted at: {{SECTION_NUMBERS}}
- Read-aloud stumble points fixed: {{NOTES}}

## Phase 8 - Voice + Bullshit Filter (separate gate)

- Voice Rules pass: applied (first person, contractions, no marketing-speak)
- Buyer-language presence - VoC quotes / paraphrases located in the draft: {{COUNT}}
- Bullshit Filter: NOT graded here - run `/convert bullshit-filter` as a separate coaching pass before shipping

## Full sales page copy (final)

{{SECTION_1_TO_16_FULL_TEXT}}

## HTML/CSS reference implementation

{{HTML_BLOCK}}

## Method coverage report
```

Method coverage report:
Open: full - all 4 layers (Nerve Strike, Side Door, Skin in Game, Fingerprint); Layer 1 sourced from a VoC quote
Three Locks: full - Want, Trust, Excuse architected across the 16 sections; mapped to VoC bank where applicable
Proof: full - claim → evidence → reason → move-on rhythm woven across the body, not boxed
Bullets: full - mixed types (K / F / Sn / Sc); each Flip and Scar traces to a VoC objection
Cascade Close: full - Stack / Vision / Math / Safety Net / Door + P.S. + P.P.S. in spec order
Greased Chute: full - paragraph rhythm + open loops at section breaks; read-aloud pass completed
Voice Rules: full - first person, contractions, no marketing-speak; banned-phrase grep clean
Temperature: {{ICE_COLD / COOL / WARM / HOT / BOILING}}

VoC inputs: {{N}} pain / {{N}} outcome / {{N}} objection quotes - sources logged

Required next step: Run /convert bullshit-filter on this draft before shipping.
The Filter is a SEPARATE pass - this skill cannot grade its own output.

```

## Notes / Cross-Skill Composition

- This skill orchestrates the other writing skills. It does not duplicate them - it calls them in order. If a sub-skill's output is weak, fix it in that skill, not here.
- **VoC bank ownership.** The Phase -1 VoC bank built here is the canonical buyer-language artifact for the offer. When `convert-vsl` or `convert-bridge-page` (advertorial) runs against the same product, reuse this bank - re-mining is wasted effort. Pass the bank file path along when handing off.
- For composite "research → write → page → audit" delivery, route through `/convert package` instead of calling this skill directly.
- For Hot/Boiling traffic where the page should be 1,500 words or less, drop sections 6, 7, and 12 to one-paragraph summaries each. Keep the rest.
- For Ice Cold traffic, expand Section 5 (Want) and Section 7 (Mechanism) - these are the "education" workhorses for cold readers.
- HTML scaffold is intentionally minimal. Designers can extend; the bones are correct.
- If the final draft fails the Bullshit Filter, do not ship. Route back to `convert-voice`, then `convert-chute`, then re-filter.
- The P.S. is not optional. Donahoe pages always close again after the close. Then close one more time in the P.P.S.

## Lineage

- Long-form direct-mail structure - Halbert (Boron Letters, 1984) and the canon of long-copy Direct Mail.
- Awareness-level sequencing - Schwartz (Breakthrough Advertising, 1966).
- Headline construction inside Layer 1 - Caples (Tested Advertising Methods, 1932).
- Slippery-slide momentum (Greased Chute) - Sugarman (The AdWeek Copywriting Handbook, 1998).
- Value-stack framing in Section 11 - informed by Hormozi-style equation logic, expressed in conversational rather than calculator form.
- The Method itself - Дархай-owned operating system. No external citation needed for the Method; cite lineage authors only where their canonical concept does specific work in a section.

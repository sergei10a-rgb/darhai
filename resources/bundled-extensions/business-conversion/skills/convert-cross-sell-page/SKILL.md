# Convert Cross-Sell Page - Post-Purchase Lateral Offer

> *"The cross-sell isn't an upsell. The buyer's already mid-implementation on the first thing. The job here is to show them the *next* product they'll naturally need - not to extract more dollars while the wallet's open."*

This skill builds the post-purchase cross-sell page: a related, lateral offer to an existing customer who's already past the OTO/downsell sequence.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: `cross sell page`, `post-purchase upsell`, `related product page`, `convert cross-sell`, `/convert cross-sell <product>`.

Use when:

- The customer has completed flagship + any immediate OTO/downsell sequence.
- A related (not duplicate, not upgrade) product genuinely fits their next step.
- The user wants to maximize LTV without breaking trust.

Cross-sells fire days-to-weeks after purchase, often from email - not seconds after checkout.

## When NOT to Use

- **Immediate post-checkout upgrade** → `/convert oto-page`.
- **OTO recovery** → `/convert downsell-page`.
- **Pre-purchase cold sales page** → `/convert sales-page`.
- **Thank-you page secondary stack** → `/convert thank-you-page`.
- **Auditing existing cross-sell** → `/convert audit`.

## Inputs

Required:

1. **What they already own** - the flagship + any OTO/downsell items purchased.
2. **The cross-sell product** - must be lateral (not the same thing they own at a higher tier).
3. **Implementation timing** - where the customer is in their journey (week 1? month 3? after the first result?). Cross-sell copy hinges on this.
4. **One person + Nerve, post-purchase version** - the new pain that emerged _because_ of the first product's success. _"You implemented [flagship]. Now you've got [new problem the cross-sell solves]."_

Optional:

- **Voice continuity from the flagship + earlier funnel.**
- **Existing customer Snapshot proof.**
- **`out_path`** - defaults via `build_report_path`.

## Workflow - All Eight Method Phases

### Phase 0 - Four Questions

Reframed for cross-sell:

- **Why You?** - Why does this matter _now_ that you've used [flagship]?
- **Why Me?** - Inherited fully.
- **Why This?** - How does the cross-sell sit alongside the flagship - what specific gap does it close?
- **Why Now?** - Real reason connected to where they are in implementation.

### Phase 1 - Temperature

**Hot.** They're a customer. Page length 600–1,200 words. Less direct-response, more relationship-pivot.

### Phase 2 - Four-Layer Open (call `convert-open`)

The Open is **anchored to their journey**:

- Layer 1 = a specific Nerve Strike about the new problem that emerged from the first product's success. _"By week three with [flagship], most people hit a different wall - and it's the kind of wall that makes the first thing feel like it stopped working."_
- Layer 2 = casual side-door pivot.
- Layer 3 = "I built [cross-sell] for exactly this stage" Skin in the Game.
- Layer 4 = Fingerprint as one-line aside.

### Phase 3 - Three Locks

- **Want** = the new desired state, _adjacent_ to the flagship's promise.
- **Trust** = mostly inherited; one customer Snapshot ("here's how someone past [flagship] used [cross-sell]") seals it.
- **Excuse** = math comparing "buy now bundled" vs. "buy later separately."

### Phase 4 - Bullets

5–8 bullets. Snapshot-heavy (similar customers + their results). One Flip is OK ("you'd think [flagship] alone would do it - and you're not wrong, until...").

### Phase 5 - Proof

One Anecdote (named customer, post-flagship) + one Receipt (specific result they got with the combo). Heavy enough to matter, light enough to not turn into a second sales page.

### Phase 6 - Cascade Close

- Stack - what's added.
- Vision - paint the combined state.
- Math - bundled-vs-separate price.
- Safety Net - guarantee mechanic.
- Door - Yes button + plain decline link.

P.S. is appropriate here (the page has more room than an OTO).

### Phase 7 - Greased Chute

Section transitions should pull forward without manufactured urgency. The customer is already loyal - pretending otherwise breaks voice.

### Phase 8 - Voice + Bullshit Filter

The biggest filter test: _"Would I email this to a customer I genuinely care about?"_ If the cross-sell doesn't fit the customer's stage, kill it. Sending the wrong cross-sell trains the buyer to ignore future emails.

## Section Architecture

| #   | Section                            | Purpose                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | Anchored open referencing flagship | Open + journey acknowledgment     |
| 2   | The new problem (one paragraph)    | Want lock - the _new_ state       |
| 3   | The cross-sell - what it is        | Mechanism                         |
| 4   | 5–8 bullets                        | convert-bullets, Snapshot-heavy   |
| 5   | Customer Anecdote + Receipt        | Trust lock                        |
| 6   | Stack + bundled-vs-separate math   | Excuse lock                       |
| 7   | Cascade Close                      | Vision → Math → Safety Net → Door |
| 8   | P.S. (recloses on the journey-fit) | Reclose                           |

CSS notes:

- The "anchor" line at the top references what the customer already owns. Without this anchor, the page reads as a generic sales pitch.
- Same green CTA as OTO/downsell - visual continuity within the customer-purchase color family.

## Output Template

```markdown
# Cross-Sell Page - {{CROSS_SELL_PRODUCT}}

**They already own:** {{FLAGSHIP_AND_ANY_OTOS}}
**Cross-sell:** {{CROSS_SELL_PRODUCT}}
**Their journey stage:** {{WEEK_3 / MONTH_2 / POST_FIRST_RESULT / etc.}}
**The new pain:** {{NEW_NERVE}}

## Phase 0–8

- Four Questions: post-purchase versions
- Open: anchored to flagship
- Locks: Want (new state) / Trust (inherited + 1 Snapshot) / Excuse (bundled math)
- Bullets: 5–8, Snapshot-heavy
- Close: Cascade + P.S.
- Voice Rules applied; Bullshit Filter is a separate downstream pass

## Final copy

- Anchor line: "{{LINE}}"
- Headline: "{{H1}}"
- Open paragraph: "{{P}}"
- New problem header + paragraph: "{{P}}"
- Cross-sell header + mechanism: "{{P}}"
- Bullets: {{LIST}}
- Customer Anecdote: "{{P}}"
- Stack: "{{P}}"
- Bundled math: "{{P}}"
- Guarantee: "{{P}}"
- Yes button: "{{LABEL}}"
- No-thanks: "{{LABEL}}"
- P.S.: "{{P}}"

## HTML reference

{{HTML_BLOCK}}

## Method coverage report
```

Method coverage report:
Open: full - all 4 layers anchored to flagship ownership; Layer 1 surfaces the new pain, Layer 4 lives in voice continuity
Three Locks: full - Want (new state), Trust (inherited from purchase + 1 Snapshot), Excuse (bundled math)
Proof: partial - 1 customer Anecdote + Receipt; remaining trust inherited from flagship purchase
Bullets: full - 5-8 bullets, Snapshot-heavy with optional Flip
Cascade Close: full - Stack / Vision / Math / Safety Net / Door + decline link + P.S.
Greased Chute: full - paragraph rhythm, open loops at section breaks
Voice Rules: full - first person, contractions, no marketing-speak, no manufactured urgency
Temperature: Warm to Hot (existing customer, journey-stage match required)

Fit: cross-sell genuinely fits the customer's current journey stage

Required next step: Run /convert bullshit-filter on this draft before shipping.
The Filter is a SEPARATE pass - this skill cannot grade its own output.

```

## Notes / Cross-Skill Composition

- This page is usually delivered via email + dedicated landing URL, not as a funnel-flow redirect. The customer arrives here with intent - the page should respect that.
- For a delivery sequence into this page, route through `/funnel ladder` or the email pack.
- If the cross-sell doesn't fit the customer's stage, do not send. The wrong cross-sell at the wrong stage trains them to ignore future communication.
- For email-list-wide announcement of a new product (not stage-targeted), use `/convert sales-page` instead - different intent.

## Lineage

- Customer-LTV cross-sell canon - direct-response info-marketing back-end strategy.
- Reciprocity at the customer-relationship level - Cialdini (Influence, 1984).
- Complementary-product bundling - behavioral-economics literature on cross-category purchase patterns.
- The Method itself - Дархай-owned operating system.

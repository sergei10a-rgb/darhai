> **Templates and analytical tools only - not legal, marketing-compliance, or data-protection advice.** Lead qualification draws on public sources only - never scrape LinkedIn (ToS §8.2), Glassdoor, G2, Capterra, or Crunchbase free-tier. Personal data captured during qualification (named individuals, role, employer) is regulated under GDPR Art. 6 (EU/UK), CCPA/CPRA (CA), and equivalent regimes - surface notice obligations downstream. Champion/economic-buyer identification must be evidence-based; never fabricate names or relationships.

# Sales Qualify - Lead Qualification Engine (BANT + MEDDIC)

Evaluate a prospect against two proven sales qualification frameworks - **BANT** and **MEDDIC** - using only publicly available information. Produces an Opportunity Quality Score (0-100) and a Lead Grade (A/B/C/D) with a recommended sales approach. Runs standalone via `/sales-qualify <url>` or as the Opportunity dimension subagent during `/sales prospect`.

## When to Use

Trigger phrases: "qualify this lead", "BANT score <url>", "MEDDIC analysis on <company>", "is this a real opportunity", "should we pursue <company>", `/sales qualify <url>` (verb form), `/sales-qualify <url>` (flat form).

Do NOT use for: deep company background research (`sales-research`), decision-maker contact discovery (`sales-contacts`), competitive landscape analysis (`sales-competitors`), or building an ideal customer profile (`sales-icp`).

## Invocation Modes

This skill is **dual-mode**.

**Standalone mode** (`/sales-qualify <url>`)

- User passes a company URL.
- Skill fetches the public surface, runs full Phase 1-4 BANT + MEDDIC analysis, and writes a Markdown report.
- Default output path: `build_report_path("business-sales", instruction)` - typically `.wayland/business-sales/<timestamp>-<slug>.md`.
- Caller may override with an explicit `out_path` argument.

**Subagent mode** (invoked by `sales-prospect` via `delegate_task(tasks=[...])`)

- Parent orchestrator pre-fetches all pages and passes them in `context.pages`.
- Child receives a fully self-contained `context` payload (see _Subagent contract_ below) - no parent context leaks otherwise.
- Child does NOT re-fetch; it analyzes the structured page data passed in.
- Child returns a JSON object matching `output_schema` AND writes a per-dimension Markdown file to the assigned `out_path`.
- Toolset for the child is `[terminal, file, web]` - `execute_code` is blocked for delegated subagents, so any helper-script work must already be done by the parent.

## Inputs

Standalone mode accepts:

- `url` (required) - company website URL
- `pages` (optional) - pre-fetched page data `{role: text}` to avoid redundant fetches
- `icp_context` (optional) - contents of an existing `IDEAL-CUSTOMER-PROFILE.md` for pain-point and budget calibration
- `out_path` (optional) - caller-controlled output path; falls back to `build_report_path("business-sales", instruction)`

Subagent mode receives in `context`:

- `company_url`, `company_name`
- `pages` - pre-fetched structured data, e.g. `{homepage, pricing, careers, about, blog, case_studies}`
- `external_signals` - pre-fetched data from LinkedIn / Crunchbase / news / G2 (parent runs `web_search` once and embeds results)
- `icp_context` - ICP pain-point map, if available
- `scoring_rubric` - the rubric below, embedded so child has it without reading parent prompt
- `output_schema` - exact JSON shape the child must return
- `out_path` - deterministic absolute path the child writes its dimension report to

## Phase 1: Data Collection

### 1.1 Primary Data Sources

Gather qualification signals from these sources. In standalone mode use `web_extract` for site pages (≤5 URLs per call) and `web_search` for external data (≤5 results per call). For raw text on long pages, use `terminal` + `curl --max-filesize 200000` instead of `web_extract`. In subagent mode, read everything from `context.pages` and `context.external_signals` - do NOT re-fetch.

### 1.2 Signal Extraction Methodology

For each data source:

1. **Fetch the source** (parent only) or **read from `context`** (subagent).
2. **Scan for keywords** related to each BANT and MEDDIC dimension.
3. **Classify each signal** as Strong, Moderate, Weak, or Absent.
4. **Record the evidence** - exact quote or paraphrase with source URL.
5. **Assign confidence level** (High, Medium, Low, Inferred).

**Confidence level definitions:**

| Confidence   | Definition                                 | Example                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**     | Directly stated or clearly observable fact | Pricing page shows $499/mo enterprise tier                  |
| **Medium**   | Reasonable inference from available data   | 5 open engineering roles suggests growing tech team         |
| **Low**      | Indirect signal requiring interpretation   | Blog post about "scaling challenges" suggests growing pains |
| **Inferred** | Educated guess based on company profile    | Series B company likely has $500K+ annual software budget   |

## Phase 2: BANT Framework Assessment

### Budget (0-25 points)

**What we are assessing:** Does this prospect have the financial capacity and willingness to purchase our solution?

**Signal detection:**

| Signal                                                  | Points | Confidence | Where to Find                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Explicit budget mentioned (rare for public data)        | 20-25  | High       | RFPs, procurement portals    |
| Recent funding round (Series A: +12, B: +16, C+: +20)   | 12-20  | High       | Crunchbase, press releases   |
| Enterprise pricing tier on their own product            | 10-15  | Medium     | Their pricing page           |
| Multiple paid SaaS tools visible in tech stack          | 8-12   | Medium     | Job posts, integration pages |
| Hiring for roles that use your product category         | 10-15  | Medium     | Job postings                 |
| Employee count suggests adequate budget (50+ employees) | 5-10   | Low        | LinkedIn, About page         |
| Cost-conscious signals (all free tools, tiny team)      | 0-3    | Medium     | Tech stack, team size        |
| Recent layoffs or cost-cutting news                     | 0-5    | High       | News, LinkedIn               |

**Budget scoring rubric:**

| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20-25 | Strong budget signals. Recent funding or clear enterprise spend. High confidence. |
| 15-19 | Good budget indicators. Company size and tech spend suggest capacity.             |
| 10-14 | Moderate signals. Budget likely exists but unconfirmed.                           |
| 5-9   | Weak signals. Budget is uncertain. May require creative pricing.                  |
| 0-4   | Poor budget signals. Early stage, cost-conscious, or financial distress.          |

### Authority (0-25 points)

## Phase 3: MEDDIC Framework Assessment

### Metrics

**What we are assessing:** What business metrics does this prospect care about? What would success look like to them?

**Research approach:**

1. Check their homepage for metric claims ("We help companies achieve X")
2. Read case studies for the metrics they highlight
3. Check executive LinkedIn posts for KPIs they discuss
4. Review job postings for OKR/KPI mentions
5. Analyze their product to infer which metrics their customers care about

**Output format:**

- Primary metrics they likely care about (3-5)
- How your solution impacts those metrics
- Evidence and confidence level for each

### Economic Buyer

**What we are assessing:** Who holds the purse strings? Who gives final approval?

**Research approach:**

1. Check team/leadership page for C-suite and VP titles
2. Search LinkedIn for the company + titles like "VP of [relevant department]", "Head of [relevant area]"
3. For SMBs: founder/CEO is almost always the economic buyer
4. For mid-market: VP or Director level in the relevant department
5. For enterprise: May need multiple approvals (VP + Procurement + Legal)

**Output format:**

- Name and title of likely economic buyer
- Evidence for why this person is the economic buyer
- Alternative economic buyers if uncertain
- Confidence level

### Decision Criteria

**What we are assessing:** What factors will they use to evaluate solutions?

**Research approach:**

1. Check if they have published evaluation criteria (RFPs, vendor requirements)
2. Analyze their job postings for tool requirements and evaluation criteria
3. Look at their current tech stack for patterns (best-of-breed vs suite, cloud-first vs hybrid)
4. Read reviews they have left for other tools (what do they value?)
5. Check their industry for common evaluation criteria

**Output format:**

- Likely evaluation criteria ranked by importance
- Evidence for each criterion
- How your solution performs against each criterion

### Decision Process

**What we are assessing:** How does this company buy software/services?

**Research approach:**

1. Company size: Smaller = faster, simpler process. Larger = committees, procurement
2. Check for procurement portals, vendor registration pages
3. Look for compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA mentions)
4. Check if they have a dedicated procurement or vendor management team
5. Analyze their existing tech stack for buying pattern (many tools = decentralized, few = centralized)

**Output format:**

- Estimated buying process (self-serve, single decision maker, committee, formal procurement)
- Estimated timeline for the process
- Key stakeholders likely involved
- Potential gates or blockers in the process

### Identify Pain

**What we are assessing:** What specific pain points does this prospect experience that we can solve?

**Research approach:**

1. Read job postings for pain-related language ("we need to fix", "improve our", "build out")
2. Check Glassdoor reviews for internal frustrations
3. Read their blog for problem-focused content
4. Search social media for complaints or challenges they post about
5. Look at their product reviews for internal process issues
6. Check industry forums for common pain points in their segment

**Output format for each pain point:**

- Pain point description
- Evidence (with source)
- Severity estimate (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Your solution's relevance to this pain
- Confidence level

### Champion

**What we are assessing:** Who could be our internal advocate? Who would push for our solution inside the company?

**Research approach:**

1. Look for mid-level managers in the department that would use your product
2. Find people who have used your product (or competitors) at previous companies
3. Identify people who post about problems your product solves

### MEDDIC Completeness Score

Calculate the percentage of MEDDIC elements with at least medium confidence:

```
MEDDIC Completeness = (Elements with Medium+ Confidence / 6) * 100
```

| Completeness | Interpretation                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 80-100%      | Excellent qualification data. Well-positioned for engagement.       |
| 60-79%       | Good data. Some gaps to fill during discovery calls.                |
| 40-59%       | Moderate data. Need discovery call to fill gaps before advancing.   |
| 20-39%       | Limited data. Early stage research. More intelligence needed.       |
| 0-19%        | Insufficient data. May need different research approach or sources. |

## Phase 4: Synthesis and Scoring

### 4.1 Opportunity Quality Score (0-100)

```
Opportunity Quality Score = (
    BANT_Score * 0.50 +
    MEDDIC_Completeness * 0.30 +
    Urgency_Modifier * 0.20
)
```

**Urgency Modifier (0-100):**

- 80-100: Active buying process or major trigger event in last 30 days
- 60-79: Recent trigger event (last 90 days) or strong urgency signals
- 40-59: Moderate urgency (industry trends, gradual pain escalation)
- 20-39: Low urgency (nice-to-have, future planning)
- 0-19: No urgency detected

### 4.2 Lead Grade Assignment

| Grade | Score Range | Label                      | Recommended Action                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A** | 75-100      | Sales Qualified Lead       | Assign to senior rep. Initiate personalized outreach immediately. Multi-thread to buying committee. Prepare custom proposal. |
| **B** | 50-74       | Marketing Qualified Lead   | Begin standard outreach sequence. Schedule discovery call. Gather more MEDDIC data. Nurture with relevant content.           |
| **C** | 25-49       | Information Qualified Lead | Add to long-term nurture. Share thought leadership content. Monitor for trigger events. Re-qualify in 60-90 days.            |
| **D** | 0-24        | Unqualified                | Do not pursue actively. Add to awareness campaigns only. Re-evaluate if major changes occur (funding, leadership, growth).   |

### 4.3 Buying Signals & Red Flags

Compile both into structured tables: each signal/flag with its **Source**, **Strength/Severity**, and **Relevance/Mitigation**. The Buying Signals table feeds the rep's outreach hooks; the Red Flags table feeds disqualification or objection-handling prep.

### 4.4 Recommended Approach

- **Grade A:** Direct executive outreach. Lead with specific ROI calculation. Reference specific pain points and trigger events. Prepare for a 2-4 week deal cycle.
- **Grade B:** Educational outreach. Lead with industry insights and best practices. Build relationship before pitching. Prepare for a 1-3 month deal cycle.
- **Grade C:** Content nurture. Share relevant resources without selling. Set trigger-based re-engagement alerts. Prepare for a 3-6 month warming period.
- **Grade D:** Marketing awareness only. Add to newsletter/blog distribution. Monitor for qualification changes. Do not invest individual sales rep time.

### Subagent mode - JSON return + Markdown file

Return JSON matching `context.output_schema` (typical shape):

```json
{
  "dimension": "qualify",
  "dimension_score": 72,
  "subscores": {
    "budget": { "score": 72, "rationale": "<one-line>" },
    "authority": { "score": 80, "rationale": "<one-line>" },
    "need": { "score": 88, "rationale": "<one-line>" },
    "timeline": { "score": 72, "rationale": "<one-line>" }
  },
  "key_findings": ["<one-line>", "..."],
  "bant_score": 78,
  "meddic_completeness": 67,
  "urgency_modifier": 60,
  "lead_grade": "B",
  "meddic_confidence": {
    "metrics": "Medium",
    "economic_buyer": "High",
    "decision_criteria": "Low",
    "decision_process": "Medium",
    "identify_pain": "High",
    "champion": "Low"
  },
  "buying_signals": [{ "signal": "...", "source": "...", "strength": "Strong" }],
  "red_flags": [{ "flag": "...", "source": "...", "severity": "Medium", "mitigation": "..." }],
  "pain_points": [
    { "pain": "...", "severity": "High", "source": "...", "solution_relevance": "Direct", "confidence": "Medium" }
  ],
  "economic_buyer": { "name": "...", "title": "...", "confidence": "Medium" },
  "champion_candidates": [{ "name": "...", "title": "...", "reason": "...", "confidence": "Medium" }],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "tier": "immediate|short_term|long_term",
      "title": "...",
      "impact": "high|medium|low",
      "effort": "low|medium|high"
    }
  ],
  "recommended_action": "...",
  "report_path": "<absolute out_path>"
}
```

**Scale conversion.** The BANT rubric grades each of the 4 sub-dimensions on a 0-25 band (sum = 0-100). For the canonical JSON above:

- `subscores.<bucket>.score = rubric_value * 4` to land on the 0-100 scale.
- Top-level `dimension_score` is the Opportunity Quality Score: `round(BANT_Score * 0.50 + MEDDIC_Completeness * 0.30 + Urgency_Modifier * 0.20)` - already a 0-100 integer.

`bant_score`, `meddic_completeness`, `urgency_modifier`, and `lead_grade` remain as auxiliary fields. The aggregator (`sales-prospect` Phase 3) reads the canonical `dimension_score` directly.

Also write the same content as Markdown to `context.out_path` so the parent can aggregate by reading files. The Markdown follows the standalone report skeleton above (BANT scorecard, MEDDIC table, signals, red flags, recommended approach).

The Opportunity Quality dimension is weighted **20%** in the `sales-prospect` aggregate.

## Notes

- **Never invent pain points.** Only report pain points you have evidence for. "They probably struggle with X" is not evidence. "Their job posting mentions needing to fix X" IS evidence.
- **Be honest about unknowns.** Much BANT information is only available through direct conversation. Score what you CAN assess and clearly flag what requires further qualification.
- **Distinguish signal from noise.** One employee complaining on Glassdoor is noise. A pattern of complaints about the same issue is a signal.
- **Trigger events must be recent.** A funding round from 3 years ago is not a trigger event. Within the last 12 months is the threshold.
- **Budget estimation should be conservative.** Better to underestimate than overestimate.
- **Timeline is the hardest to assess externally.** Be transparent. Note timeline as the first thing to validate in conversation.
- **Champion potential is speculative.** Rarely score above 7 without direct evidence.
- **Score the opportunity, not the company.** A great company with no current need scores low. A mediocre company with urgent, well-funded need scores higher.
- In subagent mode the child cannot call `execute_code` and cannot re-fetch - work only from `context.pages` and `context.external_signals`. If a source is missing, mark the corresponding finding as "not analyzable - source not provided".
- Always produce a qualification report with whatever data is available. Even incomplete data is valuable for prioritization. If BANT score is below 25 and confidence is Low/Inferred across all dimensions, recommend manual research before any outreach.
- If sibling reports (`COMPANY-RESEARCH.md`, `DECISION-MAKERS.md`, `COMPETITIVE-INTEL.md`, `IDEAL-CUSTOMER-PROFILE.md`) exist in the run directory, read them via `file_tools.read` to pre-populate company data, authority/champion analysis, current-solution context, and ICP pain alignment.
- Suggested follow-ups after a standalone run: `/sales-contacts` for decision-maker deep dive, `/sales-research` for richer company background, `/sales-icp` to refine targeting.

## Limitations

- `web_search` is hard-capped to 5 results per call; chain multiple targeted searches rather than one broad query.
- `web_extract` is hard-capped to 5 URLs and auto-summarizes pages > 5000 chars. For raw long-page text (e.g. a careers page with 40 listings), use `terminal` + `curl --max-filesize 200000` instead.
- Public-only data - no logged-in scraping, no purchased datasets. The skill intentionally produces a pre-conversation qualification, not a post-call one.
- **OSINT only.** Refuse to ingest scraped LinkedIn / Glassdoor / G2 / Capterra / Crunchbase free-tier data. Use official APIs or manual human lookup.

**LEAD QUALIFICATION - NOT LEGAL, MARKETING-COMPLIANCE, OR DATA-PROTECTION ADVICE**

Before acting on this qualification, the user must:

1. Confirm contact and signal data was sourced via OSINT or official platform APIs only - not scraped from LinkedIn (§8.2), Glassdoor, G2, Capterra, or Crunchbase free-tier.
2. Treat champion / economic-buyer identifications as evidence-based hypotheses; never name a person as a relationship contact without confirmed evidence.
3. Personal data of identified individuals (EU/UK / California persons) triggers GDPR / CCPA processing obligations downstream - confirm a lawful basis under GDPR Art. 6 and satisfy Art. 14 indirect-collection notice within one month if data came via broker.
4. Outreach derived from this qualification inherits sales-outreach Phase 0 jurisdiction gate - refuse cold to DE/AT/CH, refuse without sender postal address for US (CAN-SPAM §5(a)(5)), refuse Framework 4 / mutual-connection without documented referrer permission.

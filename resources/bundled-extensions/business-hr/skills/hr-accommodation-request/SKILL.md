# HR - Accommodation Request (Interactive Process)

Document the legally-required interactive process for medical (ADA), pregnancy (PWFA), or religious (Title VII / _Groff v. DeJoy_) accommodation requests.

## Pre-flight (REQUIRED)

1. **Type of accommodation requested**: medical (ADA) / pregnancy or related (PWFA) / religious (Title VII)
2. **Employee name, role, manager, state of employment, country**
3. **Total headcount** - Title VII / ADA / PWFA all apply at 15+ EE; many states have lower thresholds (CA FEHA 5+, NJ 1+, NY 4+ for state law)
4. **Specific accommodation requested** by employee
5. **Essential functions** of the role (from job description) - drives whether accommodation is feasible
6. **Documentation of disability/condition** - for ADA, employer may request medical certification limited to confirming the disability and need for accommodation; CANNOT request specific diagnosis or full medical records

## Statute snapshot

| Statute                         | Coverage                                                   | Trigger                                                     | Standard                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ADA (1990)** + state          | 15+ EE federal; lower in many states                       | Qualified individual with disability requests accommodation | "Reasonable accommodation" unless "undue hardship" (significant difficulty or expense)                                             |
| **PWFA (June 2023)**            | 15+ EE                                                     | Pregnancy, childbirth, related medical conditions           | Reasonable accommodation; cannot require leave if other accommodation works                                                        |
| **Title VII religious** + state | 15+ EE                                                     | Sincerely held religious belief                             | Post-_Groff v. DeJoy_ (2023): "substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of the business" - replaces old "de minimis" |
| **State equivalents**           | Varies (CA FEHA, NY HRL, IL HRA, NJ LAD, MA c. 151B, etc.) | Often lower headcount thresholds and broader definitions    |

## The interactive process - required steps

1. **Receive the request** (no magic words required - "I'm having trouble [doing X] because of [Y]" is enough)
2. **Acknowledge in writing** within 1-2 business days
3. **Discuss limitations and essential functions** - what can/can't the employee do? Which essential functions are at issue?
4. **Identify possible accommodations** - together with the employee; consider EEOC's Job Accommodation Network (askjan.org)
5. **Request supporting documentation** if needed (limited scope - confirms disability and need; not full records)
6. **Evaluate undue hardship** - significant difficulty or expense, considering employer resources
7. **Implement accommodation** OR **propose alternative** OR **deny with documented analysis**
8. **Document each step** contemporaneously - failure to document is failure to engage

## Response letters (templates)

### Grant - as requested

```
Dear [Employee],

Thank you for your accommodation request received on [Date]. After our discussion
on [date(s)] and review of supporting documentation, we are granting the requested
accommodation: [describe specifically], effective [Date].

[Implementation steps and any review date.]

This accommodation is confidential. Please contact [HR] with any questions or if
your needs change. Retaliation for requesting this accommodation is prohibited.

[HR Lead]
```

### Grant - alternative accommodation

```
Dear [Employee],

Thank you for your accommodation request received on [Date]. After engaging in the
interactive process, we determined that the specific accommodation you requested
[brief reason - does not enable performance of essential function X / would impose
undue hardship as documented]. We are providing this alternative accommodation:
[describe specifically], effective [Date].

[Implementation, review date, who to contact.]

If this alternative does not meet your needs, please let us know within [X
business days] and we will continue the interactive process.

[HR Lead]
```

### Denial - with documented undue hardship

```
Dear [Employee],

Thank you for your accommodation request received on [Date]. After engaging in the
interactive process and considering the alternatives below, we are unable to
provide the requested accommodation because it would [substantially impair an
essential function of the role / impose undue hardship].

Specifically: [detailed undue-hardship analysis from documentation above].

Alternatives we considered:
- [Alternative 1] - [why not feasible]
- [Alternative 2] - [why not feasible]

If you have additional information that may change this analysis, please share it
within [X business days] and we will reconsider.

You may appeal this decision to [next-level HR / counsel] within [10 business
days] of this letter. Retaliation for requesting accommodation is prohibited.

[HR Lead]
```

## Common pitfalls (do NOT do these)

- **Failing to document the interactive process** - failure to document = failure to engage = automatic loss
- **Asking for specific diagnosis** or full medical records - ADA confidentiality limits scope
- **Treating co-worker preference as undue hardship** - it isn't
- **Treating the employee's preferred accommodation as the only option** - alternatives are part of the dialogue
- **Discussing the request in front of co-workers** - confidentiality required
- **Considering accommodation in performance review** - separate processes
- **Pre-_Groff_ "de minimis"** for religious accommodation - overruled in 2023; standard is now "substantial increased costs"
- **PWFA: requiring leave when another accommodation works** - PWFA explicitly prohibits this

**DRAFT - REVIEW REQUIRED**

This accommodation record was generated as a starting template. It is not
employment-law advice. The interactive process is fact-specific and statute-driven.
Before finalizing:

1. Confirm interactive process documented contemporaneously - every step.
2. Confirm medical documentation request was scope-limited (no diagnosis, no full records).
3. Confirm essential functions referenced match current job description.
4. Confirm undue-hardship analysis is specific (not "we just can't") and uses
   post-Groff standard for religious accommodations.
5. If denial: have HR counsel review before delivery.
6. Verify confidential storage separate from personnel file.

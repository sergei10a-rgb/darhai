# HR - Leave of Absence

Analyze leave eligibility, document the request and response, and plan return-to-work for FMLA / state PFML / personal / medical leave.

## Pre-flight (REQUIRED)

1. **Employee name, role, state of employment, country, hire date, hours worked in last 12 months**
2. **Total headcount within 75 miles of work site** (FMLA threshold)
3. **Leave type requested**: own serious health condition / family member care / bonding (parental) / qualifying military exigency / military caregiver / pregnancy disability / personal
4. **Expected duration** and **start date**
5. **Whether leave is intermittent / reduced-schedule / continuous**
6. **Prior leave used in same 12-month period**
7. **State of employment** - state PFML or state FMLA-equivalent may apply even when federal FMLA does not, AND vice versa (run BOTH)

## Federal FMLA (1993) - quick reference

- **Employer eligibility**: 50+ employees within 75-mile radius of the worksite
- **Employee eligibility**: 12 months of service (not necessarily consecutive) AND 1,250 hours worked in past 12 months
- **Entitlement**: 12 weeks unpaid, job-protected per 12-month period (26 weeks for military caregiver)
- **Qualifying reasons**:
  - Own serious health condition
  - Care for spouse, child (under 18 or adult disabled), or parent with serious health condition
  - Bonding with new child (birth, adoption, foster) within 12 months
  - Qualifying military exigency
  - Care for covered service member with serious injury or illness (26 weeks)
- **Pay**: unpaid (employee may use PTO concurrently if employer policy allows)
- **Health insurance continuation**: maintain group health benefits as if active
- **Reinstatement**: same or equivalent position
- **Notice**: employee 30 days advance for foreseeable; "as soon as practicable" otherwise. Employer must provide rights and responsibilities notice within 5 business days of becoming aware of qualifying reason.
- **Certification**: employer may require medical certification (limited scope) within 15 calendar days

**Key**: state PFML is generally **wage-replacement** (state-administered), federal FMLA is **unpaid + job-protected**. They run concurrently where applicable. Some state laws also provide job protection separate from PFML (CA CFRA, NY PFL).

## Intermittent-leave tracking

When leave is intermittent or reduced-schedule:

```markdown
## Intermittent Leave Tracker - [Employee]

| Date   | Hours/Days Used | FMLA Bucket | State Bucket | Cumulative      | Notes                        |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [Date] | [X hrs]         | [used]      | [used]       | [running total] | [reason / certification ref] |

Reset date: [12-month period start]. Rolling backward / calendar / fiscal - match policy.
```

## Return-to-work plan

```markdown
## Return-to-Work Plan - [Employee]

**Last day of leave:** [Date] | **Return date:** [Date]

- Reinstatement role: same / equivalent - [Title]
- Schedule: [Standard / phased return]
- Accommodations on return: [If any from interactive process - see /hr accommodation-request]
- Fitness-for-duty certification received: [Y/N - if required uniformly]
- Manager 1:1 scheduled: [Date]
- Re-onboarding tasks: [tools, project briefings, key meetings]
- Lactation accommodation (if applicable per PUMP Act + state): [private space, break time]
- Performance: leave is not factored into performance evaluation
```

## Common pitfalls

- **Counting only federal FMLA** - many states are stricter (CA CFRA 5+ EE, NY PFL 1+ EE)
- **Denying state-only leave** because federal doesn't apply
- **Asking for diagnosis** - certification scope is limited
- **Charging fitness-for-duty selectively** - must be required uniformly
- **Counting leave against attendance / performance** - interference + retaliation risk
- **Not maintaining health insurance** during FMLA/state PFML
- **Failure to provide rights-and-responsibilities notice** within 5 business days

**DRAFT - REVIEW REQUIRED**

This leave analysis was generated as a starting template. It is not employment-law
advice. Eligibility math is unforgiving and statute-driven. Before finalizing:

1. Verify federal FMLA AND state PFML / state FMLA-equivalent eligibility separately.
2. Verify wage-replacement coordination with state agency (CA EDD, NY DOL, etc.).
3. Verify health insurance continuation during leave.
4. Verify rights-and-responsibilities notice issued within 5 business days.
5. Verify medical certification scope is limited (no diagnosis, no full records).
6. If intermittent: confirm tracking method and 12-month reset rule match policy.
7. Have HR counsel review denials.

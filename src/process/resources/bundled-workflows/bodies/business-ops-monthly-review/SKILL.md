# Monthly Review

**Estimated time:** about 60 seconds

This workflow pulls the month's metrics from the provided data sources and drafts
a monthly business review, carrying trend continuity forward from the prior
monthly review when one is supplied. It runs as a deterministic two-action
pipeline once the inputs are known.

## Steps

**Step 1: Gather the Data Sources**

Confirm the inputs before pulling anything. You need `data_dirs`: the paths to the
monthly data sources. This input is required, so if it is missing, ask the user
for it and wait. Optionally accept `prior_review_path`: a file path to the prior
monthly review for trend continuity. If it is not provided, proceed without it.

- Input: data_dirs (required), prior_review_path (optional)
- Output: confirmed source paths for the metrics pull
- Key focus: do not proceed without a valid data_dirs path

**Step 2: Pull the Monthly Metrics** (uses: ops-report)

Pull the month's metrics from the confirmed data sources in monthly-metrics mode.
Read the sources and extract the month's key numbers. If the pull fails
(unreadable or missing sources), halt and report the error rather than
fabricating numbers; do not advance to the draft.

- Input: data_dirs from Step 1
- Output: the pulled monthly metrics
- Key focus: real numbers from the sources; halt on a pull failure

**Step 3: Draft the Monthly Review** (uses: ops-report)

Draft the monthly business review from the pulled metrics in
monthly-review-draft mode. If a prior monthly review path was provided, read it
and carry trends forward so the draft shows month-over-month movement rather than
a standalone snapshot. Output the metrics alongside the draft.

- Input: monthly metrics from Step 2, prior_review_path from Step 1 (optional)
- Output: the metrics plus the drafted monthly business review
- Key focus: month-over-month trends and a clear business-review narrative

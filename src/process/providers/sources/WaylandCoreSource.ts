 * Wayland Core catalog source (main process).

 * Wayland Core (`wcore`) is a backend execution engine, not a model provider:
 * it runs whatever model the user connects through a real provider (Anthropic,
 * OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, ...). It has NO model catalog of its own — its models
 * are exactly the models of the connected providers, surfaced by their own
 * `ApiProviderSource`s.
 *
 * Therefore `listModels()` honestly returns `[]`. This is not a stub: it is the
 * correct answer. The downstream assembler unions every source's output, so
 * Wayland Core's connected models still reach the catalog via their providers.

 * deliberate fix for the old Foundry "notebooks leaked into every chat" bug:
 * knowledge is never global, it is anchored to one workspace and surfaced only
 * through a project-scoped MCP server (see ./mcpConfig).
 *
 * Idempotent: existing files are never overwritten, so user edits survive
 * re-bootstrap (e.g. when a workspace is set on an existing project).

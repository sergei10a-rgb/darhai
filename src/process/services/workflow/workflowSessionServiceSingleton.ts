/**
 * Module-level singleton accessor for the live `WorkflowSessionService`.
 *
 * The service itself is dependency-injected through `initWorkflowBridge` (see
 * `src/process/utils/initBridge.ts`), but call sites outside the bridge —
 * notably `agentUtils.buildSystemInstructions*` — need a no-arg way to reach
 * it so they can compose the `WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL` system block for any
 * conversation that carries a `workflowSessionId` in its config. Using a
 * lazy singleton keeps the agentUtils module free of construction-order
 * coupling and avoids a heavier DI rewrite.
 *
 * Initialization order: `initBridge.ts` constructs the service inside the
 * usage-bridge `.then` and immediately calls `setWorkflowSessionService`.
 * If a caller hits the getter before that lands, it returns `null` and the
 * caller is expected to soft-fail (the protocol block is best-effort —
 * losing it is non-fatal to the first-message build).

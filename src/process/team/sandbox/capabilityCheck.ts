 * Single source of truth for "is capability X granted on team Y" queries.
 * Used by the MCP tool dispatch (TeamMcpServer) and will be reused by the
 * workspace-FS IPC handlers in W4c.
 *
 * Contract (W4 audit CRIT-2 fix — 2026-05-19):
 *   - Imported teams (`team.importedFrom != null`) ALWAYS consult the
 *     per-capability grant map regardless of the `isSandboxed` flag. The
 *     `isSandboxed` flag is informational/visual only — it drives UI
 *     badges and prompt-injection wrap, but the security gate is the
 *     grant map itself. Granting one cap NEVER de-sandboxes the team.
 *   - Non-imported (legitimately user-created) teams: full trust by
 *     definition; every capability is considered granted.
 *
 * `assertCapGranted` throws `TeamSandboxedError` (defined in W4a) so the
 * existing MCP error path serializes a uniform message to the agent.

/**
 * Atomic file-write helpers for state files.
 *
 * Plain writeFile/writeFileSync truncates the destination then streams bytes.
 * If the process crashes mid-write the file is left empty or partial and the
 * next launch fails JSON.parse — losing analytics IDs, CDP registry state,
 * Wayland config, or user workspace paths.
 *
 * The helpers below write to a sibling `.tmp-<pid>-<ts>` file first, then
 * rename into place. POSIX rename is atomic on the same filesystem, so a crash
 * leaves either the old file intact or the new file fully written — never a
 * truncated half.
 *
 * Scope: state files only. User-content writes (where partial output is
 * recoverable by the user) intentionally do not use these helpers.
 *
 * --- RT-S1: cross-platform confidentiality of the temp file ----------------
 * The sibling temp file is created inside the SAME directory as `targetPath`.
 * For secret-bearing writes (callers pass `{ mode: 0o600 }` — config/env/chat
 * blobs, analytics id, models cache) that directory is userData/config, which
 * on Windows is already ACL-restricted to the current user, so the temp file
 * inherits an owner-only ACL by default.
 *
 * Node IGNORES the `mode` option on Windows, so 0o600 alone is a no-op there.
 * As defense-in-depth (in case the parent dir's ACL was widened, or the file
 * is created somewhere with a permissive inherited ACL), when the caller asked
 * for owner-only POSIX perms we ALSO restrict the Windows DACL explicitly:
 * strip inherited ACEs and grant the current user full control, applied to the
 * temp file before secrets are flushed AND to the final file after rename.
 * This is best-effort (icacls failures are swallowed) — the inherited
 * owner-only ACL of userData/config remains the baseline guarantee. POSIX
 * behavior is unchanged.

/**
 * Cron-aware pre-warm for the lazy AI SDK loaders.
 *
 * Background: the four AI provider SDKs (anthropic, google/genai, openai,
 * aws-sdk/client-bedrock) defer their module evaluation until the first
 * call into the corresponding provider. This keeps idle main-process RSS
 * lower for users who don't actively use a given provider. But scheduled
 * (cron) tasks that fire in the background would pay that first-call
 * latency (~200-500 ms) on their first run.
 *
 * Solution: at boot, after the cron service loads enabled jobs from the
 * database, call this with the list of backends referenced by those jobs.
 * SDKs referenced by cron jobs are pre-loaded eagerly; SDKs not referenced
 * stay lazy.
 *
 * The mapping intentionally only covers backends that talk directly to
 * an AI provider from THIS process. ACP backends (claude / codex / qwen /
 * goose / kimi / opencode / codebuddy / droid / auggie / copilot / qoder /
 * vibe / cursor / kiro / hermes / snow / custom) spawn their own external
 * CLI binaries and don't use our in-process SDKs — they don't need pre-warm.
 * Same for the 'wcore' (spawned Rust engine), 'remote' (WebSocket), and
 * 'nanobot' / 'openclaw-gateway' (external CLIs) backends.

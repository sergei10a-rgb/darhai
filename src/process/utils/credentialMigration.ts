/**
 * One-shot startup migration: re-encrypt every channel plugin's credentials
 * from the legacy base64-obfuscation formats (`b64:` / `plain:` / `enc:`) to
 * Electron `safeStorage` ciphertext (`enc:v1:`).
 *
 * Before this migration credentials sat in SQLite as base64 — anyone with
 * read access to `wayland.db` could recover every Slack/Twilio/AgentMail bot
 * token in seconds. The crypto upgrade in `credentialCrypto.ts` switches new
 * writes to OS-level encryption; this module sweeps the existing rows.
 *
 * Gated by `ProcessConfig.get('system.credentialsCryptoMigrated_v1')`. Once
 * the flag is `true` the migration is a no-op on every subsequent launch.
 * If the host OS does not expose safeStorage (Linux without libsecret,
 * headless container without dbus, etc.) the migration short-circuits and
 * deliberately leaves the flag unset so it can retry on the next launch.

/**
 * Bcrypt event-loop saturation guard (AUDIT-04 F6 / M1, Option B).
 *
 * bcryptjs is a pure-JS implementation that runs on the main event loop.
 * At cost 12 a single comparison can occupy the loop for ~250-400ms, so a
 * distributed login attack from a botnet (which trivially defeats the
 * per-IP login limiter) can stall every other request handler on the
 * process.
 *
 * This module exposes a single global counter that bounds the number of
 * bcrypt operations allowed to run concurrently. When the cap is reached
 * further attempts reject immediately with BcryptBusyError; the /login
 * route maps that to HTTP 503 with a Retry-After hint so legitimate
 * traffic keeps moving while attackers see fast rejections instead of
 * unbounded queueing.
 *
 * Implementation note: pure JS bcrypt is single-threaded on the loop, so
 * "concurrent" here means "in-flight Promise count" not "parallel
 * threads". Capping in-flight count still matters because it bounds the
 * size of the pending-callback queue and keeps memory pressure flat
 * under attack.

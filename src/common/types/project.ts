/**
 * A Project is an umbrella that owns conversations. Each conversation keeps full
 * freedom of backend / model / assistant — the project does not constrain that.
 * Scoping is carried on the conversation via `extra.projectId` (mirrors the
 * `cronJobId` pattern), so there is no per-conversation column and no execution
 * lock. The project entity itself lives in the `projects` SQLite table
 * (migration_v43).
 *
 * Deliberately leaner than Foundry's IProject: dropped `defaultAgent` /
 * `defaultModel` (the composer picks per-chat), `forgeInitialized`, and
 * `activeConversationId` (the per-project execution lock that serialized every
 * chat — the core friction we are removing).

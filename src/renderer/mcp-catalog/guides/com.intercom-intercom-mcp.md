    body: |
      Intercom hosts the MCP server at `https://mcp.intercom.com/mcp`
      (legacy SSE endpoint also available at `https://mcp.intercom.com/sse`).
      Дархай connects over `streamable-http`. Nothing to download.

      **US-only:** per Intercom's docs, the hosted MCP is currently only
      supported on US-hosted workspaces. EU and AU workspaces aren't
      supported yet - check your Intercom workspace region before
      continuing.

    body: |
      Click **Sign in with Intercom** below. A browser tab opens to
      Intercom's OAuth consent screen.

      1. Sign in with the Intercom workspace whose conversations and
         contacts you want Дархай to access. If you have multiple
         workspaces, pick the right one from the workspace switcher.
      2. Review the requested permission groups - per Intercom's MCP docs:
         **Read and list users and companies**, **Read conversations**, and
         **Read and write articles**.
      3. Click **Authorize** to grant access. The tab redirects back to
         Дархай and the server status flips to Running.

      The OAuth token is stored in your local OS keychain. To revoke later,
      open your Intercom workspace settings, find the authorized-apps
      area, and remove the Darhai connection.

# Intercom setup

Intercom hosts the MCP server at `https://mcp.intercom.com/mcp`. Click sign
in and approve read access to conversations, users, and companies.

## Step 2 - Sign in

A browser tab opens to `intercom.com`. Approve the two read scopes - the
server is read-only, so the agent can search conversations and contacts but
cannot send messages.

**Region note:** US-hosted Intercom workspaces only. EU and AU workspaces
are not supported yet.

Revoke any time from Intercom's connected apps settings.

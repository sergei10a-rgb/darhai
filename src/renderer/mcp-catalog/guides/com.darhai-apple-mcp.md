      The Apple Ecosystem MCP is bundled with Дархай - there's nothing to
      download. It speaks to macOS apps directly through EventKit (Calendar,
      Reminders), AppleScript (Notes, Mail), MapKit (Maps), and the Photos
      framework. macOS only; the entry is hidden on Windows and Linux.

      If the server crashes on launch, click **Reinstall** to rebundle the
      native binary and reset its sandbox.

    title: Grant Full Disk Access to Darhai

    body: |
      macOS guards Notes, Mail, and the EventKit databases (Calendar /
      Reminders) behind Full Disk Access. Without it, every tool call returns
      an empty list or a permission error. Photos and Maps each use a separate
      framework consent dialog that pops the first time they're touched.

      1. Click **Open System Settings → Privacy & Security** above. macOS
         opens the **Privacy & Security** pane scrolled to **Full Disk
         Access**.
      2. If **Darhai** is already listed, flip its toggle **on**. If not,
         click the **+** button, navigate to `/Applications/Darhai.app`, and
         click **Open**. macOS will ask for your password or Touch ID.
      3. macOS warns that Darhai must restart to pick up the permission -
         click **Quit & Reopen** (or restart Дархай manually).
      4. Back in Дархай, click **Done - verify access** above. We'll probe
         EventKit and confirm the grant landed.

      First call into Calendar or Reminders may surface a one-time EventKit
      consent dialog - approve it. Photos and Maps do the same on first use.

# Apple Ecosystem setup

This MCP reads from and writes to your local macOS apps directly - no cloud,
no API keys, no telemetry. Everything stays on the device.

      reinstall from this page.

      Exa gives every new account free trial credits on signup - enough to
      try the server before you commit. Pay-as-you-go after that, no
      subscription required.

      1. Click **Open Exa dashboard** above. Sign in or create an account
         at `dashboard.exa.ai`.
      2. Left sidebar → **API Keys**.
      3. Click **Create new key**. Name it anything (e.g. *Darhai*).
      4. Copy the key shown - it's displayed in full only once.
      5. Paste it into the `EXA_API_KEY` field above.

      Usage and remaining credits live under **Dashboard → Usage**.

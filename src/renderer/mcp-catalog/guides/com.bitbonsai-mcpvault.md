      Дархай fetches `@bitbonsai/mcpvault` from npm via `npx` on first
      launch - no manual install needed. The server reads and writes your
      vault directly as Markdown, with no Obsidian plugin and no running
      Obsidian app required. Requires Node 18+.

      - { name: OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH, label: "Absolute path to your vault" }
    body: |
      mcpvault needs an absolute path to the folder that holds your
      `.md` notes. It only touches files inside that path.

      1. In Obsidian, right-click your vault in the file sidebar →
         **Reveal in Finder** (macOS) / **Show in Explorer** (Windows) /
         **Open in file manager** (Linux).
      2. Copy the full absolute path of the folder. Examples:
         - macOS: `/Users/you/Documents/MyVault`
         - Windows: `C:\Users\you\Documents\MyVault`
         - Linux: `/home/you/Documents/MyVault`
      3. Paste it into the `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` field above.

      **Heads up:** mcpvault runs in read/write mode by default - it can
      create, edit, and delete notes (14 tools across notes, search, tags,
      and backlinks). Back up your vault, or point it at a copy first if
      you want to try it safely. The server only touches files inside the
      path you supplied.

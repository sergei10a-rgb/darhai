      Raindrop hosts the MCP server at `https://mcp.raindrop.io` - nothing
      to install. Дархай connects via streamable HTTP on first use.

    body: |
      Click **Sign in with Raindrop** below. A browser tab opens at
      Raindrop's OAuth consent screen.

      1. Sign in to Raindrop.io if you aren't already.
      2. Approve the **raindrop:read** and **raindrop:write** scopes -
         this lets Дархай read your bookmarks/collections and save or
         edit new ones.
      3. The tab redirects back to Дархай and the server status flips
         to Running.

      **Prefer a test token instead?** Open
      `app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations` → click **+ Create new app**
      → name it → open the app → copy the **Test token** field. Test tokens
      only work for the app owner's own account, which is exactly what you
      want for a personal MCP install.

      Дархай connects to Box's hosted MCP at `https://mcp.box.com` -
      nothing runs locally. Box doesn't support automatic OAuth client
      registration, so you'll register a Box Custom App once (the next step
      walks you through it) and Дархай reuses your credentials.

    warning: |
      If your account is on a **Business / Enterprise** plan, your Box admin
      may need to enable the Box MCP server from **Admin Console →
      Integrations → Box MCP server → Configure** before personal OAuth will
      succeed. Hit that error and you'll need to ask them first.
    body: |
      The first time you click **Sign in with Box** Дархай opens a dialog for
      your own Box Custom App's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. The dialog
      walks you through creating the app at **app.box.com/developers/console**
      and shows the redirect URI to paste in.

      After you save the credentials, Дархай opens a browser tab to
      `account.box.com` and prompts you to sign in. Box then shows a **Grant
      access** consent screen requesting three scopes:

      - `root_readwrite` - read and write files and folders you select.
      - `ai.readwrite` - use Box AI to summarize and analyze content.
      - `docgen.readwrite` - generate documents with Box Doc Gen templates.

      Pick which folders the integration may touch - start narrow (one
      folder), widen later. Approve, and the tab redirects back to Дархай.

      The token lives in your OS keychain. Revoke any time at
      **app.box.com → Account Settings → Apps → Authorized apps**.

and run Box AI on your selected content.

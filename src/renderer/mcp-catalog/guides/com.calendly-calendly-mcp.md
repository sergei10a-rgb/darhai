      Calendly hosts the MCP server at `https://mcp.calendly.com` - Дархай
      connects over `streamable-http`. Nothing to download. Skip to Step 2
      to authorize.

      Click **Sign in with Calendly** below. A browser tab opens to
      Calendly's OAuth consent screen.

      1. Sign in with the Calendly account whose event types and scheduled
         events you want Дархай to read.
      2. Calendly shows the requested access (event types, scheduled
         events, and invitees). Click **Authorize** to grant.
      3. The tab redirects back to Дархай and the server status flips to
         Running.

      **Plan requirement:** Calendly API access requires a Standard,
      Teams, or Enterprise plan. The Free tier cannot authorize the MCP.

      Tokens are stored in your local OS keychain. To revoke later, sign
      in at `calendly.com`, open **Account settings → Integrations** and
      remove the Darhai connection from the connected-apps list.

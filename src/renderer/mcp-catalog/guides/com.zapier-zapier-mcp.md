      Zapier hosts the MCP server for you at `https://mcp.zapier.com` -
      there's nothing to install locally. Дархай connects over streamable
      HTTP and authorizes via OAuth in the next step. Zapier manages all
      downstream app credentials (Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, etc.) on its
      side, so you never paste per-app keys here.

      Configure the actions Zapier should expose first, then come back to
      authorize.

      1. Click **Open Zapier MCP dashboard** above. Sign in with your
         Zapier account (or sign up - free tier works).
      2. In the MCP dashboard, pick which **Actions** Дархай is allowed
         to run. Each enabled action becomes a tool Дархай can call.
         Start narrow - you can add more later.
      3. Come back here and click **Connect Zapier**. A browser tab opens
         to Zapier's OAuth consent screen.
      4. Approve the connection. The tab redirects back to Дархай and
         the server status flips to Running.

      **Quota:** Zapier MCP is in open beta and uses your existing Zapier
      task quota - each MCP action consumes 2 tasks. There's no separate
      SKU. You can rotate the connection or revoke specific actions any
      time from the Zapier MCP dashboard.

# Zapier setup

Zapier MCP lets Дархай trigger actions across 9,000+ apps - Gmail, Slack,
Salesforce, Notion, and the rest - using the same Zapier connections you
already have.
